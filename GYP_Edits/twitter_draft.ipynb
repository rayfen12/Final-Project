       "'@Adaripp @TeamWarren Thank you for joining @TeamWarren in Las Vegas, @AdaRipp—we can’t wait to have you back again soon!Our grassroots donors are pretty surprised when I call to say thanks—someone even thought I was a recording. But I promise, it\\'s really me! And if you donate now, I might just call you tonight to say thanks: https://t.co/1wHTXr1sDs https://t.co/dX5cWYMKpJKate McKinnon is really fabulous. I\\'m with @SethMeyers—big kudos to the @NBCSNL costuming department! https://t.co/slzFNaH8dX@PanickedFoodie Under #MedicareForAll, mental health care will be treated as what it is—critical health care. #CripTheVoteWe cannot ask our military to solve problems that cannot be solved militarily. We have to use every diplomatic and economic tool we have—and we need a sound strategy guiding us. Trump\\'s reckless, dangerous actions are only escalating this crisis and putting our military at risk. https://t.co/x348lAlU6u@cdubbs420 @jamie95126953 Programs and policies meant to deter opioid abuse should not force millions of Americans to lose access to critical medicine and live in pain. My administration will take care to balance both priorities. #CripTheVote@KylaGraceP I\\'ll fight to end the loss of SSI benefits for individuals that are admitted to medical facilities or emergency homeless shelters for longer periods of time. I’ll also expand SSI to citizens in territories like Puerto Rico to establish equal rights to SSI for all. #CripTheVote@KylaGraceP People with disabilities deserve financial security. My plan increases SSI to the federal poverty line, revises income limits, and ends rules that force people to choose between critical benefits and financial independence, saving, or marrying the person they love. #CripTheVote@Sblahov I’ll fight to make Election Day a national holiday, require all federal elections to have a minimum of 15 days of early voting, expand voting hours, allow the option to vote with a sworn statement of identity instead of an ID, and offer voting by mail. #CripTheVote@Sblahov Participating in our democracy should be accessible for all. I’ll ensure polling locations are conveniently located and have accessible ballot machines for people with disabilities. I’ll also research improving voting security and accessibility for everyone. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility Thank you @DisVisibility, @GreggBeratan, and @AndrewPulrang for hosting this chat! I look forward to working with #CripTheVote to build a truly inclusive country.@DisVisibility What are the things that you\\'re fighting for—and how can leaders in government be better listeners? #CripTheVote@DisVisibility Disability will not be an afterthought in my administration—it will be a priority. We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life, and together, I know we can realize a truly inclusive world. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility We also have a volunteer working group of leaders in the disability community who help us connect with the larger community. My campaign—and my administration—will always seek the input of the community as we govern. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility We have staff with disabilities across the campaign. Their lived experiences and talents help foster an inclusive and accessible campaign. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility As president, I will fight alongside the disability community for justice across all aspects of life and to fulfill the goals of the ADA—equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self sufficiency. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility Last week—in collaboration with advocates and thanks to hundreds of emails, letters, and selfie line conversations—I released my plan to protect the rights and equality of people with disabilities: https://t.co/q3fmdClP13 #CripTheVote@DisVisibility All policy issues are disability policy issues, which is why I’ve approached many of my previous plans with a disability rights lens, from criminal justice reform, to ensuring a high-quality public education for all, to strengthening our democracy. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility From fostering an inclusive economy and ensuring access to affordable, quality health care for everyone to developing new technology and responding to climate change, we must put disability rights front and center. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility People with disabilities are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion—and if we want to build a country for everyone, we need to work together to combat ableism and build big, structural change. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility The disability community has been fighting for a more just future and a better country for everyone. From the fights to protect the ACA to the stories I’ve heard at town halls and the letters I\\'ve been sent, I’ve been so grateful to them for sharing their stories. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility We have campaign staff with disabilities across the campaign and a Director of Disability Outreach to coordinate with the community. From offices to event spaces to selfie lines, we\\'re committed to making our campaign accessible. #CripTheVote@DisVisibility I\\'m committed to making my campaign inclusive. We spent months listening to and working with a volunteer working group of leaders in the disability community to develop our plan to protect the rights and equality of people with disabilities. #CripTheVoteI look forward to answering your questions at our first-ever #CripTheVote Twitter Town Hall! https://t.co/VpqcGrOuq1I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. When I saw how the economy was rigged against working families—how the giant banks rigged the bankruptcy system to squeeze struggling families—I decided to get into this fight. https://t.co/b01h869X1TLooking forward to joining the #HotTopics table on @TheView shortly—tune in! https://t.co/0BYKRCwDXwMy heart and thoughts are with the people of Puerto Rico today. I know they are resilient and I\\'ll fight to ensure they receive the disaster assistance they need and deserve to recover from these earthquakes. https://t.co/BW8ObH62YbThe fundamental question: Who should our democracy work for—the wealthy and the well-connected, or everyone else? I made the decision to run a grassroots campaign instead of sucking up to billionaires. If you think that\\'s the right way to run, join us: https://t.co/F7bVFxFifB https://t.co/PCz89oWJeiThe banking industry wants you to believe people who file for bankruptcy are reckless or irresponsible. The truth is that they\\'re struggling with rising costs and flat wages. One crisis is enough to send them over the edge. They don’t need shaming. They need relief.Finally, I\\'ll close the loopholes that allow the wealthy and corporate creditors to abuse the bankruptcy system at the expense of everyone else.Bankruptcy also doesn’t affect all people equally. Women and people of color are more likely to file for bankruptcy, which is partly a reflection of wealth and income disparities. I\\'ll take additional steps to target specific problems to help eliminate these shameful disparities.My plan also makes it easier for people to protect their homes and cars in bankruptcy so they can start from a better foundation as they try to rebuild their financial lives.We have a student loan debt crisis in America in part because our bankruptcy system makes it nearly impossible to get rid of that debt, even when you have nothing left. While I\\'m fighting to cancel student loan debt, I\\'ll also fight to make that debt dischargeable in bankruptcy.Bankruptcy law places certain spending limitations on people while they’re in the process of bankruptcy. My plan pares back some of those burdensome limits—like those that prevent families from paying rent—so families have a chance to recover after the bankruptcy process.My plan starts by making it easier for people being crushed by debt to obtain relief through bankruptcy by streamlining the process, reducing the costs of filing, and giving people more flexibility in bankruptcy to find solutions that match their financial problems.In 2005, the banking industry pushed through a bill to change our bankruptcy laws so they could squeeze everything they could out of families. The bill hit working families hard and resulted in 250,000 more foreclosures during the financial crisis. It\\'s time for an overhaul.I spent most of my career studying why American families go broke. What I discovered was that they weren\\'t reckless or irresponsible—they were being squeezed by an economy that forced them to take on more debt, and one bad break sent them tumbling over the edge.This economy is pushing struggling families to the breaking point, and our bankruptcy laws make it harder for them to get back on their feet. That\\'s not right. I\\'ve got a plan to overhaul our consumer bankruptcy rules. https://t.co/WNanN0p2fbCovered a lot of ground on @LateNightSeth—from our campaign to Kate McKinnon’s impression of me. I also told @SethMeyers I’ll be calling some grassroots donors who donate today to say thank you. Chip in $3 now, and I could call you next! https://t.co/OlHSIySOEFI\\'ll be on @LateNightSeth on @NBC soon to talk about the big, structural change I\\'m fighting for. I hope you\\'ll join us!I just finished speaking with @Maddow about the urgency of our moment. We can make our economy and government actually work for the people—but only if we fight for it. Chip in $3 before tomorrow, and I could give you a call soon to say thanks! https://t.co/Mx2CLUlDL6I\\'ll be speaking with @Maddow shortly about how to build a country and an economy that works for everyone—tune in on @MSNBC!At town halls in Davenport, Iowa, and across the country, people tell me about what\\'s broken—about the things they\\'re afraid of. But in spite of the fear, they have hope that things can change, because they believe in America, and in each other. And I believe, too. https://t.co/i9BlIaFaGO@RogerLau I hate to say “I told you so,” but... I told you so!Together, we imagined a country where everyone has a fighting chance. Thank you, Dubuque! https://t.co/3zJXDiTJ4pThere\\'s nothing I love more than having real conversations with voters about how to build the big, structural change we need. So in Maquoketa, Iowa, I went canvassing door-to-door!\\n\\nIf you\\'re ready to knock doors, too, sign up for a canvass training! https://t.co/tLKQnjLFTe https://t.co/jRv4lrK3jZDonald Trump is dangerous. He\\'s repeatedly undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain. He’s escalated tensions and driven crises. We cannot allow his reckless actions to drag us back into another war. https://t.co/D461kdCiOEThese reports are deeply disturbing. Iranian Americans have the same rights as all other U.S. citizens and should be treated with dignity and respect at our border—not bigoted, xenophobic scrutiny. https://t.co/FOYVZSG0K5Right now our government and our economy are working great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not so much for everyone else. Every family should have the opportunity to thrive, and @JulianCastro and I are going to fight for that—together. https://t.co/moWHQaSzkwThe way I see it, this election is about fighting for the big ideas that reflect our values—here in Manchester, Iowa, and everywhere in America. 2020 is our time to dream big, fight hard, and win. https://t.co/IrZIRZExwYThank you, @JulianCastro! You’ve been a powerful voice for bold, progressive change and I’m honored to have your support. Together, we\\'ll fight to make sure every single family in America has a path to opportunity. https://t.co/uHs7DP4DcUNow let’s make sure we value their work! I’ve got a plan to boost wages for women of color and open up new pathways to the leadership positions they deserve. https://t.co/54WDOq56co https://t.co/LAaWUp9vBTWe have to pick up each other\\'s fights. Because that\\'s how we\\'ll build a better America for our kids and grandkids—by fighting together. https://t.co/RzH6qlAoWmOur achievements weren\\'t born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. Our best moments have been when we see a challenge and mobilize to meet it head-on. In Hanover, New Hampshire, and all across the country, Americans are ready to fight for a brighter future. https://t.co/uR6i9IQOKRCongratulations to new dads Daniel and Scott—a double woo-hoo thank you for knocking doors with @TeamWarren in Ohio! https://t.co/TseyzBORRuI’m so grateful for the hard work of @IAForWarren organizers like @Anna_Navin! https://t.co/ux9WDVSfDII have the best team. Here’s how they get our selfie lines done so that we can take great photos together! https://t.co/vOYXbIGhCrI look forward to chatting with #CripTheVote this Tuesday! https://t.co/MMOyCkT7YJYesterday, Reagan and Elle asked me two important questions in Iowa. Here are my answers: https://t.co/CRUzbxOejt@drjenharvey Tell Emery I\\'m so sorry that they couldn\\'t join us—but they’re an important part of this fight, and I\\'m proud to fight alongside them!Our selfie line is an opportunity to listen to your stories and hear why you got in this fight. Selfie by selfie, photo by photo, person by person—we’re growing our grassroots movement together. https://t.co/NOiYH4JvINThank you, @LatinoCommFdn! https://t.co/i9FSY2mlPECouncilwoman @MitraJNelson is right. My heart is in solidarity with the Iranian-American community. We must fight for our democracy now more than ever so that it has space for all our communities. https://t.co/YLAx8rT5DgYou are threatening to commit war crimes. We are not at war with Iran. The American people do not want a war with Iran. This is a democracy. You do not get to start a war with Iran, and your threats put our troops and diplomats at greater risk. Stop. https://t.co/RoXRgb9GsKBefore I hit the photo line, I put on my sneakers. https://t.co/9VGZhVmLSCIt’s official: #WarrenSelfie 100,000 in Manchester, Iowa! I don’t spend my time asking rich donors for big checks—I  spend it with voters. Our selfie line gives me a moment (or 100,000) to meet our movement. https://t.co/IgDMFs8Z4ERacists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered and protected by Donald Trump—and we’re seeing the violent consequences.\\n\\nWe have to get Trump out of the White House and fight against white nationalist violence. https://t.co/i9qYOEdqvOWe need to call out the fact that Americans with disabilities are excluded from economic opportunity and denied financial security. I have a plan to fight and change that.\\nhttps://t.co/DdnfhX4FQsAbout time. I called for a criminal investigation of the Wells Fargo CEO in 2016, and successfully pushed for the bank\\'s board members to be held accountable.\\n\\nWhen CEOs and top bankers break the law, they should go to jail—just like anyone else. https://t.co/cWTWPkvWpGWoo-hoo! Glad to see @TeamWarren Okies hard at work in my home state.\\n\\nAs we get closer to voting, having conversations with voters is one of the most important things we can do. The good news is you can start making calls now, from wherever you are! https://t.co/MvE5hzPWAT https://t.co/ltMxYRpX0GThe problem isn\\'t big government versus small government.\\n\\nThe problem is a government that\\'s been captured by the rich and powerful.\\n\\nThe solution is creating a government that works for everyone—not just the wealthy and well-connected.New Hampshire\\'s legislature passed a bill to raise the minimum wage—and Gov. Sununu vetoed it.\\n\\nWe need to raise the federal minimum wage so everyone, in every state, has a living wage that can support themselves and their families. https://t.co/Ggz32Kq1mVIf you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness, you\\'re more than halfway there. First you have to see it. Then we fight for it. \\n\\nBetween selfies and pinkie promises in Concord, I heard those dreams. Together, we\\'ll build that future. https://t.co/k8xxURXuAFJust a few hours into the new year, another trans American was killed in a senseless act of gun violence.\\n\\nDustin Parker was a father, a husband, and an advocate who looked out for his community. We must fight for justice for him and all trans Americans. https://t.co/3FzFythjUqNobody fighting for climate action should be afraid that they’re going to lose their job. In a Warren administration, I will fight to protect and strengthen workers’ voices, especially those who are holding their employers accountable. \\nhttps://t.co/t9JmRuGoFnToo many \"American\" companies have only one real loyalty: The short-term interests of their shareholders. If they can outsource jobs to save a nickel, that’s exactly what they\\'ll do.\\n\\nWe have to defend good American jobs—and I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/UbLfugQ9uUThe catastrophic scenes from Australia\\'s wildfires should alarm all of us. Climate change is driving even more dangerous and destructive fires across the world, from California to New South Wales—and we must fight together to defeat this crisis. https://t.co/DQMd9O75mtThe Trump administration is expanding its dangerous and cruel \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, putting the lives of even more asylum seekers at risk. As president, I\\'ll reverse this policy and ensure that asylum seekers are welcomed. https://t.co/ZFISzZT0v2People with disabilities, like Sarah, are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion—and I\\'ll be fighting alongside them. Together, we built a plan to fight for justice and inclusion. https://t.co/73q1P3EPd8Donald Trump is dangerous and reckless. He\\'s escalated crises and betrayed our partners. He\\'s undermined our diplomatic relationships for his own personal, political gain.\\n\\nWe cannot allow him to drag us back into another war. We must speak out.All three of my brothers served in uniform. I know the sacrifices we ask of them and their families. Trump’s actions put every service member and diplomat in the region at risk. This is a moment for vigilance—for Americans to speak up and speak out. No more Middle East wars.Donald Trump ripped up an Iran nuclear deal that was working. He’s repeatedly escalated tensions. Now he’s assassinated a senior foreign military official. He’s been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won’t stand for it.We’re on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East—one that would be devastating in terms of lives lost and resources wasted. We’re not here by accident. We’re here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.I called Laura, a teacher, to say thank you. We agreed: We need a teacher in the White House! \\n\\nI\\'m so grateful for every single person who chips in to our grassroots campaign. This is how we can win—together. https://t.co/RqGIlh3c1kIn 2019, nearly one million donors pitched in to raise more than $71 million for our grassroots movement—with zero closed-door fundraisers. \\n\\nI\\'m so deeply grateful for everyone supporting our campaign. Team Warren is ready to dream big, fight hard, and win! https://t.co/RJbv79UzvlSoleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.Right now, employers are allowed to pay people with disabilities wages as low as 4¢ per hour. This is shameful. People with disabilities have the same rights to fair wages and economic security as everyone else. I\\'ll fight to end the subminimum wage. https://t.co/0sQqwefSAuRepublicans want to turn back the clock, outlaw abortion, and deny people reproductive health care—and they\\'re hoping the Supreme Court will back their radical play. We need to take back the Senate and pass federal laws protecting our reproductive rights. https://t.co/PVlS8imk7X@JustStimming Thank you, @JustStimming, for making sure we had those details right. I’m in this fight alongside you all the way!@SeeMiaRoll @TeamWarren I’m deeply grateful for all of your work on this plan and for your work on the ground in North Carolina, @SeeMiaRoll. I’m proud to fight alongside you for justice for people with disabilities.Issues of racism can\\'t just be issues for Black and Brown women—they must be issues for all of us. I talked with @AshantiGholar on @TheBGGuide about the Black-white wealth gap, student debt, and how my plans will build an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/21UOdYGOWvSarah sent me a letter asking me to make sure that people with disabilities like her brother aren\\'t left behind. \\n\\nSarah, here\\'s my promise to you both: I will fight so he can get all the care and services he needs to live a self-determined life in a community that loves him. https://t.co/qDUuIbAn4y@ElenaHung202 I’m proud to fight alongside you—for Xiomara and all our kids. This is how we’re going to win, together!I’m fighting for @MattBC and @CosetTheTable, and all disabled Americans, because no one should be forced to choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love. https://t.co/uWplCcLxq7@aneeman Thank you for your tireless advocacy and hard work, @ANeeman. I’m grateful to have you on the working group for this plan!I\\'ll fight to expand and reform Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income to ensure financial security for all. I\\'m deeply grateful to @JulianCastro for helping shape this conversation—and look forward to working side by side to enact these changes.@RebeccaCokley Thank you, @RebeccaCokley, for taking my call and helping build this plan. I’m proud to work with you!@VilissaThompson Thank you so much for your thoughtful work on this plan and for being a part of @BlackWomxnFor, @VilissaThompson. Intersectionality is how we get this done! I’m proud to fight alongside you.New technology can foster accessibility for people with disabilities—if it\\'s affordable. My hearing aid law will help bring down costs, and my administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies for everyone who needs them. https://t.co/EwUXdDTLcOThank you, @MaysoonZayid. Together, we\\'ll fight for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion for all. https://t.co/2tEjQ3ubp4We all do better when everyone has the opportunity to fully participate in all aspects of life. Together, we can realize a truly inclusive world. Because when we organize together, when we fight together, and when we persist together, we can win.Finally, we must lead the fight for disability rights worldwide. Under Trump, the U.S. has neglected its responsibility to be a leader in human rights, including disability rights. As president, I\\'ll make disability rights a priority in my foreign policy.As we transition to #MedicareForAll, I will roll back harmful work requirements, enrollment caps, and Medicaid premiums allowed by the Trump administration—to ensure that Americans with disabilities can get the care they need.Health care is a human right, but too many people with disabilities face barriers to quality care. We need a system that empowers all people to live full lives and that reflects our values. That system is #MedicareForAll.As we tackle environmental injustices and climate change, we must put disability rights front and center. That means accessible and green housing and transportation—and inclusive emergency planning, response, and recovery.For people with disabilities, finding affordable housing can be even more difficult due to limited accessible options and discrimination. My administration will fight to ensure they have a decent, affordable, and safe place to live, and strengthen anti-discrimination protections.From criminal justice to voting, immigration, and protecting parents with disabilities from discrimination, my administration will safeguard the rights and civil liberties of people with disabilities and work to ensure that our society and democracy are truly inclusive.My administration will work to bring down the costs of assistive technologies that allow people with disabilities to lead fuller lives. We\\'ll also enforce existing anti-discrimination laws and propose new regulations that specifically address discrimination in technology.New technology has brought many positive changes for people with disabilities—but it can be used in ways that discriminate against them or exclude them from an increasingly digital world. I will fight to ensure that technology is used to advance their interests.My administration will support children with disabilities, their families, and their educators by providing crucial early interventions and ensuring kids have meaningful access to a high-quality public education. And we\\'ll tackle discriminatory policies and practices head-on.We must also rewrite the rules of government programs that trap people with disabilities in poverty. No one should be forced to wait months to receive assistance or choose between critical benefits and marrying the person they love. I\\'ll fight to expand and reform these programs.As president, I\\'ll fight for economic security for people with disabilities by rewriting the rules of the economy to end labor market discrimination and exploitation, and foster inclusivity. That starts with fighting for a $15 minimum wage—and ending the shameful subminimum wage.Disability activists have organized for years to fight injustice. 2020 marks the 30th anniversary of the ADA, and though we\\'ve made significant progress, we still have a lot of ground to cover. In my administration, disability rights and equality will be a top priority.People with disabilities are still fighting for economic security, equal opportunity, and inclusion—and they’re not fighting alone. As president, I\\'ll partner with the disability community to combat ableism and fight for justice across all aspects of life. https://t.co/y9yk7wzwsFThank you @JulianCastro for being a powerful voice, for proposing bold and progressive plans, and for using your campaign to help people who need it now. You made this race stronger—and you will continue to be a leader in our party and our country for many years to come. https://t.co/SWlsDC9HcSAmericans do big things. That’s who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on. So let\\'s begin this new year with big dreams and bold plans!What are your aspirations and dreams for 2020? \\n\\nIf you weren\\'t stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? If you weren\\'t crushed by debt, what would you do? If you lived without worrying if you could afford the health care and prescriptions you need, how could you thrive?Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds. As we welcome in 2020, let\\'s take a minute to imagine what our country could look like—what our own lives could look like—in a better future.As we look ahead to 2020, let\\'s imagine what our country could look like on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the past three years. That future is possible when we believe in ourselves and in each other—and when we have the courage to fight for it. Happy New Year! https://t.co/4tgLpL7wKxJuliette chipped in to help meet our end-of-quarter goal, so I called her to say thanks! If you chip in $3—or whatever you can—before tonight\\'s deadline, I might call you later, too. Dream big, fight hard, and have a safe and happy New Year! https://t.co/5Cad3GoY4I https://t.co/NWqLbMl060If I call you on the phone, just call me Elizabeth! I called Keith to say thanks for contributing to this grassroots campaign. And if you chip in $3 (or whatever you can) before tonight\\'s deadline, I could call you next! https://t.co/5Cad3GoY4I https://t.co/MVE4A9Tlq9Thank you, @AshleyJudd. Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington and make our democracy work for everyone. https://t.co/7SiuwstsB8Imagine the future America you want to live in. \\n\\nThat future is possible—and if we dream big and fight hard, we can build it together. https://t.co/WeltmjjWBiI called @choo_ek to thank her for donating to our grassroots campaign and for being a part of @TeamWarren. We\\'re going to do this—together.\\n\\nChip in $3 or whatever you can before tonight\\'s deadline, and I could call you soon! https://t.co/5Cad3GoY4I https://t.co/fpfmPmVl0nWoo-hoo! @TeamWarren is still sending out a free sticker to anyone who chips in to our campaign—from now until tonight’s FEC deadline. Chip in $1 or more to claim yours now. https://t.co/DAiIQ8qUP9I called Jaylin to say thanks for chipping in to our grassroots campaign and being a part of this fight. Together, we can make big, structural change in 2020. \\n\\nChip in $3—or whatever you can—and I could call you soon! https://t.co/5Cad3GoY4I https://t.co/RWWQgc7U29There’s still time to enter if you haven’t already! https://t.co/9WXW7b5ZxqJonathan chipped in $5 to our campaign, so I gave him a call to say thanks! We talked about my plans to root out corruption in Washington and how we can grow our grassroots movement.\\n\\nChip in whatever you can and I might call you next! https://t.co/5Cad3GoY4I https://t.co/ttmBuNnP70In the face of hatred, injustice, and oppression, Black Americans throughout our history have never stopped imagining and fighting for a better tomorrow. Black history—American history—has shown us the way to the America of our highest ideals. #Warren2020 https://t.co/ZI5BTfb2CWIf you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years—then you are more than halfway there. \\n\\nThe first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. #Warren2020 https://t.co/iOjnHhNQudThere are less than 12 hours until our most important FEC deadline, and our fundraising is still behind last quarter’s.\\n\\nI’m counting on grassroots supporters like you to help close the gap. Will you contribute $3 now to help meet our $20 million goal? https://t.co/UiemcHaeVdOur achievements and victories were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams. #Warren2020 https://t.co/PaEejSKENQ@isaroconnor Stay strong out there, Isabella. I know that together, we can elect another wave of progressive women up and down the ballot in 2020 and beyond. Let’s do this!Our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head on.\\n\\nFighting back is an act of patriotism. #Warren2020 https://t.co/M9eZtQzW8BTrump’s reckless decisions to walk away from the Iran Deal and now to launch airstrikes in Iraq without Iraqi government consent have brought us closer to war and endangered U.S. troops and diplomats. We should end the forever wars, not start new ones.Let us begin tomorrow committed to dream big, fight hard, and win. Happy New Year! #Warren2020I believe that when future generations of Americans look back on this time, they will celebrate us for choosing hope over fear. I believe they will see that we fought to build an America of our best values—an America that works for everyone. #Warren20202020 is our fight: Our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country. Our chance to come together despite our differences and mobilize a movement for change. #Warren2020We know that the America we imagine together is possible when Americans believe in ourselves and in each other—and when we have the courage to fight for it. #Warren2020But we know in our hearts that power in America can rest with the people. We can and we must have an economy and a democracy that finally works for everyone. #Warren2020Those with power dump an endless avalanche of excuses, misdirections, and distractions on the American people. It’s all designed to get us to give up and resign ourselves to the way things are—with them in power and everyone else left behind. #Warren2020We begin this fight with a hard truth: No one who has power in Washington is going to give it up easily. #Warren2020If you can imagine all this—if you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years—then you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it. #Warren2020Imagine an America where no matter the color of your skin, who you love, how you worship, where you were born, or what zip code you live in, you are safe and your opportunities look pretty much like everyone else’s. #Warren2020Imagine an America where the lived experience of women is reflected in committee rooms and corner offices, and yes, even at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. #Warren2020Imagine an America where more women—women of color, LGBTQ+ women, women with diverse backgrounds—have more power to make the right decisions for our country. #Warren2020Imagine what’s possible when poor communities and communities of color are no longer dumping grounds for toxic wastes and polluting industries. #Warren2020While the survival of every living thing on this planet hangs in the balance, while fossil fuel companies still call the shots in Washington, imagine an America that has come together to beat back the climate crisis and embrace a #GreenNewDeal. #Warren2020Imagine an America where monthly social security checks are big enough to cover the bills and leave a little extra for home repairs or an occasional meal out—or maybe birthday presents for the grandchildren. #Warren2020Imagine an America where black maternal health is a priority. Imagine an America where, if you get really sick, you can concentrate on getting well—and not worry about bankruptcy. #Warren2020Imagine an America where #MedicareForAll ensures health care is a basic human right. Imagine an America where you could get your prescriptions filled, without worrying about the cost. #Warren2020Imagine fleeing violence and oppression and finding an America that matches our best values every day and welcomes asylum seekers and refugees with care and compassion. #Warren2020Imagine a country where every young adult is treated as so valuable to all of us that technical school, two-year college, or four-year college is tuition-free and ready to welcome every one of them. #Warren2020Imagine a country where every child is treated as so valuable to all of us that their education is a top priority. Imagine a country where teachers are deeply respected for the work they do—and paid accordingly. #Warren2020If you were no longer stretched to make ends meet, who would you be? A coach? A volunteer? A parent? And if you could make these changes, what opportunities would it open up, for you? For your children? For your grandchildren? #Warren2020If you were no longer paying half your income in rent, what could you do? Pay off your credit cards? Put money in a savings account? Get a dog? (That idea came from Bailey—but think about it.) #Warren2020If you were no longer tied to your job in order to pay off student loan debt, where would you go? Try a different job? Move back to your hometown? Start your own business? #Warren2020Imagine how you could thrive if America was safe for everyone. If you lived in a community without fear—without fear of oppression, of violence, of anti-semitism, white supremacy, and police brutality—how would you live your life? #Warren2020Imagine what our country could mean for you. Imagine who you could be if America worked for everyone. #Warren2020My determination to lead a movement has been forged by the tens of thousands of people who have said they are ready to fight for the country they know we can be. #Warren2020My will to fight has been strengthened by the people who have whispered their dreams into my ear. #Warren2020My plans for this country have been influenced by letters pressed into my palm by little girls. #Warren2020One year into this campaign, you’ve never found me behind closed doors with corporate executives or spending hours on the phone sucking up to rich donors to fund my campaign. #Warren2020Over the past year I’ve had the chance to shake hands or hug nearly 100,000 people in more than 180 town halls across the country. We have many differences—but we are ready to fight side-by-side for our common aspirations. #Warren2020Exactly a year ago today, I got in the race for president. And I made the decision to run a campaign straight from the heart. I am deeply grateful that so many of you have put your full hearts into this campaign, as well. #Warren2020On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to end the rigged economy and to create a new set of rules—rules that give everyone a chance to succeed. #Warren2020On day one, we will start to make big, structural change to put the people in charge of our democracy—so we hear everyone’s voice and count everyone’s vote. #Warren2020When I am president, we will attack corruption in Washington head-on. We will attack the concentration of power that makes this government work great for the wealthy and well-connected, and not for much of anyone else. #Warren2020We come together to imagine this reality because this reality is now within our reach. #Warren2020Imagine a country where no politician has to kiss the rings of the rich in order to win elected office. #Warren2020Imagine a country where big drug companies and the insurance industry don’t stand between Americans and the basic health care they need. #Warren2020Imagine a country where the NRA and gun industry don’t get to put their own profits above the safety of our children. #Warren2020Imagine a country where private prisons and detention centers don’t exist and no one makes a profit from locking people up. #Warren2020Imagine a country where the fossil fuel industry doesn’t have a grip on our planet. #Warren2020Imagine a country where the decisions made in Washington aren’t simply bought and paid for by lobbyists and big donors. #Warren2020Taking the time to see ourselves and our world better than they are today sparks urgency in our hearts and determination in our minds. #Warren2020Imagining alone won’t be enough. But imagination is powerful. It forces us to contemplate change in our lives; to begin to expect change. #Warren2020So, just for a moment, here on the eve of a new year, let us come together to imagine. Imagine what our country will look like—imagine what your own life will look like—when we finally turn this page in our history. #Warren2020Our greatest achievements were not born of fear. They were born of boldness and big dreams—of our unique ability to imagine a better world so clearly and thoroughly that we fought for it with everything we had, and turned things we could only imagine into reality. #Warren2020We became the world’s leading industrial producer and simultaneously gave workers the right to join unions and live decent lives. We created breakthroughs in science and technology and connected the world through the internet. We rocketed to the moon. #Warren2020Americans do big things. That’s who we are. And our best moments as a country have been when we see a challenge clearly and we mobilize to meet it head-on. #Warren2020We are a nation that fights back. Fighting back is an act of patriotism. #Warren2020As we turn the page tomorrow—into an election year and a new decade—there is a chill of fear in the air. People are afraid, and the danger they feel is real. Our democracy hangs in the balance. And now it comes to us—now it comes to us to fight back. #Warren2020House Democrats upheld their sworn duty and impeached the president. Soon, I will return to the Senate to do mine as well. But unless some Senate Republicans choose truth over politics, Donald Trump will be emboldened to try to cheat his way through another election. #Warren2020In the past 12 months, the president has become bolder with his lies and law-breaking. He tried to squeeze a foreign government to advance his own personal fortunes. Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress have turned into fawning, spineless defenders of his crimes. #Warren2020In a few hours, the dawn of a new year will break over America, offering us a moment for pause and reflection. It is normally a moment for optimism. But let’s face it—this year in America has been anything but normal. #Warren2020A year ago today, we launched this campaign for big, structural change. In just a few minutes, I\\'ll be speaking live about the optimism I\\'ll be carrying into 2020. #Warren2020 https://t.co/cN5FfQAtUPIt\\'s been a year since we launched our campaign and our fight to protect the promise of America—and since then, our fight has only become more important. In 2020, we will dream big, fight hard, and win. https://t.co/PPGVA5uKqOEveryone should be free to worship and celebrate without fear. We have to stand up and fight against hate, bigotry, and anti-Semitic violence—and in a Warren administration, we\\'ll use every tool we have to defeat it.Call time is a chance for me to talk with grassroots donors and listen to their stories—regardless of how much they were able to give to our campaign.\\n\\nI’m making more calls tomorrow! Will you chip in $3 now to help reach our end-of-quarter goal? https://t.co/4zY1f8Py6e https://t.co/dieyguKJzKThis Tuesday at 11 AM ET, I\\'ll be speaking in Boston on the one-year anniversary of launching this campaign. Bookmark this page now to watch the speech live tomorrow! #Warren2020 https://t.co/haT8eujW72We shouldn\\'t have to live like this. In 2020, we have to fight to put an end to the daily toll of gun violence that is devastating our communities—including mass shootings. https://t.co/NHGWECzCifClimate change. Gun violence. Health care. \\n\\nWe have a lot of good ideas for how to fix these issues, and the majority of Americans are with us. And yet we don\\'t make change. Why? \\n\\nCorruption, pure and simple. We\\'ve got to root it out—and I\\'ve got plans for that.Here\\'s my advice to young women on running for office: Fight from the heart. That\\'s how you\\'ll be strong, and that’s how you’ll persuade others to join you. https://t.co/ON7bor8CHeWorking families in Des Moines and across the country deserve a fighting chance. That’s why I have a lot of plans—from increasing Social Security benefits to canceling student loan debt—that will help rebuild our middle class and put power in the hands of the people. https://t.co/Qcwy483ZMd@CrystalGallego7 I’m sorry I missed you—but thank you for being in this fight!It\\'s also time to ensure our government works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected. I\\'ll end lobbying as we know it—and I\\'ll shut the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington. https://t.co/1UGyTCTLFaMy Real Corporate Profits Tax ensures that very large and profitable companies pay taxes on their reported profits—no loopholes or exemptions. And I\\'ll make it harder for companies to hide their profits in offshore tax havens. https://t.co/kSJ4yCy2lsToo many corporations are cashing in on all the benefits of America while skipping out on the bill. Companies that make massive profits shouldn\\'t be paying less in federal income taxes than working families. It\\'s time for them to pay their fair share—and I\\'ve got plans for that.Trump is the most corrupt president in history, and here’s the latest example of how that corruption helps giant corporations at the expense of small businesses and working families. https://t.co/ZWewF54jMvIt’s been a really great year! https://t.co/Tx4MMh2jNwRich people may have a whole lot more of a lot of things. But that doesn’t mean they should own a bigger piece of our democracy. https://t.co/Idz7bLdYvkFred doesn’t usually answer unknown numbers, but Bruce and I are glad he picked up today!

He’s always been a fighter, and I know he\\'ll continue making good trouble. Stay strong, John. https://t.co/2ffoL3KPx8The richest Americans with the biggest fortunes keep getting richer, and the wealth gap just gets wider and wider.

I can’t wait to meet Tabi today.2020 is our chance to dream big, fight hard—and win. https://t.co/YCEM0L6cZfI\\'m heartsick for the victims of this horrific attack. This is unfortunately just the latest of a series of anti-Semitic attacks in New York and New Jersey. We must fight anti-Semitism and make clear that hateful bigotry has no place in our society. https://t.co/MjlL1gkovV.@JVN and I look forward to meeting you soon! https://t.co/hJ57E49tF8He’s on vacation, but Logan from Maine still picked up the phone when I called to thank him for being a donor! Logan chipped in $3—and that $3 makes a difference as we work to close our fundraising gap before the FEC deadline.\\n\\nWill you chip in $3, too? https://t.co/4zY1f8Py6e https://t.co/vUj09tln3IMoniqua, a small business owner in Georgia, chipped in $20 to our campaign—so I just gave her a call to say thanks!

My plans will increase wages for child care workers and make it easier to form a union. https://t.co/K1MrYe7HUfI don’t spend my time at fancy fundraisers asking wealthy donors for donations. With 37 days until the #IAcaucus, I’m spending my time with the people.\\n\\nToday, I’m thanking grassroots donors for chipping into our campaign. Chip in $3 now—and I could call! https://t.co/TF4FESLVAUI’m so grateful to have @ZachWahls on @TeamWarren. Zach is a fighter for progressive values and working families, and together we’ll keep dreaming big and fighting hard in Iowa. https://t.co/qSC64I98xvClimate change is an existential threat—and we\\'re running out of time.\\n\\nIn 2020, we need to elect a president who will fight this crisis. I\\'ll fight to root out the corruption in Washington, pass a #GreenNewDeal, and create millions of green jobs. https://t.co/WOCkNn0LpgI wouldn’t ask if it weren’t important: Will you chip in $3 now to help hit our campaign’s end-of-quarter fundraising goal?\\n\\nThis is a critical time to invest in Iowa and other states before voting and caucusing start, and we can only do it together! https://t.co/HnE9T7iO7ZAs a working mom, I went through one child care arrangement after another. I felt like a failure until my Aunt Bee stepped in to help.\\n\\nLet’s be clear: My plan for #UniversalChildCare will make high-quality child care free for millions of families and affordable for everyone. https://t.co/cNXSSDM5oeWe need to call out white supremacy for what it is: Domestic terrorism. In a Warren administration, we will use the Justice Department to end its rise.\\nhttps://t.co/yeX31SrhB1@BassBassriley Thank you, Bryan, I’m really grateful. We’re in this fight together!When working people fight, working people win. Let’s do this, @SEIU. https://t.co/G7U931pG7wThis election isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. \\n\\nWe’re already in a fight. \\n\\nThis is about how we win.A small group of the wealthiest families gobbled up a massive amount of wealth, while the middle class was hollowed out. \\n\\nThis wasn\\'t an accident.\\n\\nHere\\'s how my #WealthTax will level the playing field. https://t.co/n3nFLK5t3uFamilies should be able to get an education without being drowned in debt. They should be able to go to work without child care costs eating up their paychecks. They should be able to get the health care they need without risking bankruptcy.\\n\\nWe need big, structural change.Keep your phone nearby!\\n\\nThis weekend, I’ll be calling grassroots donors to thank them for chipping in to our campaign. Will you pitch in $3 tonight? I hope we’ll talk soon. https://t.co/xixsav2BqXWe\\'re closing out the decade with a widening wealth gap and millions of families drowning in debt due to the costs of health care and higher education. \\n\\nIn 2020, let\\'s fight for big, structural change to build an economy that works for everyone. https://t.co/f7wwARZYnnIf you make it big—and I mean really big, top one‑tenth of one percent big—pitch in a few cents so everyone else gets a chance to make it, too. \\n\\nIt’s really that simple.Someone had a bit too much Christmas dinner! https://t.co/15sqFpsk08Like I said at the debate, my #WealthTax will boost our economy. And top economists agree with me. https://t.co/D2IapQBYwaThe best way to grow the economy isn\\'t by giving more money to billionaires and corporations already sitting on piles of money, but by helping working families struggling with the costs of health care, child care, housing, and education.  https://t.co/oxMp4Qgq5PBruce and I are wishing a very happy Kwanzaa to everyone celebrating this week!One year ago today, Felipe Gómez Alonzo died in CBP custody. He was just eight years old.\\n\\nThis Christmas, I\\'m heartsick for all of the families who won\\'t be celebrating together today because of the Trump administration\\'s cruel treatment of immigrants and asylum-seekers.From our family to yours: Have a very merry Christmas! https://t.co/Yjen1RNJ8cBailey wishes you a very Merry Christmas! https://t.co/2pZ4LfX3UzImagine: Your parents go through all that effort to dress you in your holiday best, take you to see Santa, and all they get is a mildly terrified photo! (I figured it out eventually.) https://t.co/daA3CHNEOsI stand with Amazon\\'s workers, who are doing back-breaking work this holiday season. Everyone deserves time to spend with their families. And I know that when workers fight together, they can win. https://t.co/FjFuFSyCLrI never thought I’d be back in my high school gym, running for president of the United States. But you know, you don’t get what you don’t fight for. https://t.co/jT3wM9UE7FThese are difficult times, and yet my heart is filled with hope. It’s because of the people I meet at town halls in Cedar Rapids and all across the country: They\\'re struggling, they\\'ve got challenges, but they still believe in a better America—and they\\'re willing to fight for it. https://t.co/uzvKpZQW49Our government is working great for the wealthy and well-connected at the expense of everyone else.

We’re in this fight together. https://t.co/BU3diOqwS8Dennis Muilenburg pressured regulators and put profits ahead of the safety of passengers, pilots, and flight attendants. His firing is welcome news—and long overdue. https://t.co/55Kfr1c0ohWe had our Oklahoma City town hall at my former high school—where my high school debate trophy is still on display! Public school made me, and that debate team gave me so many incredible opportunities. I believe in our public schools, and that\\'s why I\\'m fighting for them. https://t.co/J5QT6iC78RI never thought I\\'d be back in my high school—this time as a candidate for president of the United States. But you don\\'t get what you don\\'t fight for! https://t.co/KHo2l0RJ9yBy the time I graduated high school, my folks couldn\\'t even afford a college application—much less four years of college. High school debate gave me amazing opportunities, and it was great to meet Oklahoma’s state champions! https://t.co/XNx4dcCw1wOklahoma, it was good to be home! https://t.co/oh0y8cpLglIn Ottumwa, Iowa, I talked about how a free press is a powerfully important part of any democracy. My administration will fight to protect journalists and the First Amendment. https://t.co/T68rSRJ3XjWe won’t make any progress on any of the issues we care about until we root out corruption in Washington—and I’ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/c7DCGyYeOGReal freedom isn’t letting big corporations prevent workers from taking a better job.  \\n\\nReal freedom is a government ban on non-compete clauses so workers can choose the job that’s best for them.\\nhttps://t.co/5pEopxOANrOur country\\'s top turkey companies are getting sued for allegedly conspiring to raise prices. Each of the four major meat industries are now under investigation for price-fixing and collusion. Enough. It’s time to enforce our antitrust laws against Big Ag. https://t.co/8dgteD0KM9It\\'s great to be back in Oklahoma! Tune in now for a live look at our Oklahoma City town hall. https://t.co/hL62CjKlrAWe need to use every tool we have to combat voter suppression. I\\'ll fight to defend our right to vote and build the grassroots movement to win in 2020. https://t.co/JnHzFlB0OCTargeting families trying to reunite with their children is despicable and cruel. Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and his administration are willing to go to any lengths to harm vulnerable families—and we’ll fight to hold them accountable. https://t.co/ojFPAHon6CBruce and I are wishing a happy Hanukkah to everyone celebrating the Festival of Lights this week.

Kennedy said we would send a man to the moon in under a decade, people said it\\'d be impossible. But American ingenuity rose to meet the challenge. Today, we face a new challenge—climate change. And American ingenuity can rise again to meet it. https://t.co/OiiJR8CNSe https://t.co/TRnKFXEHgsWe need a candidate for president who can draw the sharpest distinction with the corruption of the Trump administration. We need to show that we\\'re willing to fight, not just for the wealthy and well-connected, but for everyone else. That’s why I’m in this fight. https://t.co/eG3u8tBiAqThe way I see it, this election is about who our government is going to work for—the wealthy and the well-connected, or working families like the ones I met in Burlington, Iowa?\\n\\nI know which side I\\'m on. I\\'m fighting so that our government and our economy work for everyone. https://t.co/PFJDkQbml9America has a long and proud history of rising to the challenges that have faced this country—and defeating the climate crisis is no exception. #GreenNewDeal\\nhttps://t.co/VM7g7gF2mQLet’s be clear: Dreamers are #HereToStay despite the Trump administration’s cruelty. From showing up for the #SCOTUS DACA hearings, to my plan to protect immigrants, our campaign stands with Dreamers all the way. https://t.co/LMiDjXYv8PI don\\'t do fancy fundraisers with millionaires and billionaires. Instead, I spend my time grabbing a beer (and an iced tea!) with donors like Mike and Linda, who chipped in a few dollars to my campaign, because I think grassroots donors should be deciding the Democratic nominee. https://t.co/9hlmsvgFRgIn some states, creating a shell company to hide your identity is easier than getting a library card. It\\'s time to tackle the global flow of dark money—and I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/OCxtAX5eRM https://t.co/ubR1nyithnI grew up on the ragged edge of the middle class.

Now it\\'s on us to fight for real reform, including federal standards for the use of force. https://t.co/byoaUmN01PThe Trump administration is trying to throw up every barrier they can to make it harder for people to get the care they need. We have to fight back—and we need to elect a president who will protect the right to an abortion. https://t.co/tgl7zayFNzFamilies are struggling. They\\'re working hard—even working multiple jobs—and yet sometimes they\\'re just barely scraping by. It\\'s time to make sure our economy is working for working people—in Keokuk, Iowa, and across the country. https://t.co/fOqwRQaVBuWhat would it mean to your family if we canceled student loan debt?

No matter what issue they care about—their schools, the environment, gun violence—if we fight together, from the heart, we can win. https://t.co/9eKMVHXrECEfforts to silence @PramilaJayapal are deeply troubling. The U.S. and India have an important partnership—but our partnership can only succeed if it is rooted in honest dialogue and shared respect for religious pluralism, democracy, and human rights. https://t.co/hx5H5RpxqgThe #GreenNewDeal isn\\'t just an agenda for reducing carbon emissions and defeating the climate crisis—it\\'s an opportunity to transform our economy and create millions of good, new jobs. American ingenuity can rise to meet this challenge.The transition to clean energy is an opportunity to transform our economy, creating new industries and greatly expanding others. My administration will create new financing tools to unlock investments to tackle climate change, including a Green Bank and Green Victory Bonds.As part of my 100% Clean Energy Plan, I\\'ll take action to achieve zero-carbon pollution from all new buildings, and improve the energy efficiency of existing buildings. This will create over 970,000 new jobs.America’s water infrastructure is crumbling, leaving us vulnerable to climate crises and putting our drinking water at risk. My administration will protect Americans by rebuilding our nation\\'s water infrastructure—and creating about 190,000 good, union jobs.Transportation is one of the largest sources of U.S. carbon pollution. As we rebuild our crumbling transportation infrastructure, we can create a transportation system powered by electricity rather than fossil fuels, build in climate resiliency, and create about 2.6 million jobs.The clean energy sector is rapidly expanding—and as part of my 100% Clean Energy Plan, my administration will focus on rebuilding and repowering our energy grid, creating 6.8 million good jobs, while cutting carbon pollution.To develop the green workforce of the future, we\\'ll invest in expanding job training, and we\\'ll make sure no worker is left behind as we transition to a clean economy. My administration will work hand-in-hand with unions to ensure these jobs have good wages and strong benefits.I mean it when I say that defeating the climate crisis will be a top priority in my administration. My plans will enact a climate change agenda that not only reduces our carbon emissions, but also jumpstarts our economy and creates millions of new jobs.When faced with seemingly impossible challenges, American ingenuity has risen to meet them. We can do it again and defeat the climate crisis. The #GreenNewDeal is an opportunity to invest in a green economy and create 10.6 million new jobs. https://t.co/QLB6WueyUoI’m grateful down to my toes for everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate—and for everyone who pitches in to keep our campaign growing.\\n\\nWill you join us? https://t.co/PvyiWXEohFWe made the decision many years ago that rich people in smoke-filled rooms wouldn’t pick the next president of the U.S.\\n\\nPeople need to believe you\\'re going to stand up to the wealthy and well-connected when you\\'re president—and I intend to keep my promise to the American people. https://t.co/kzWLGNqiLaIt’s a very special #DemDebate when I get to have so much of my family here with me. https://t.co/YwcQLNLDtAI’m not working for millionaires and billionaires.

That includes harnessing the power of our oceans to be a key part of our solution to the climate crisis. The future of our planet depends on healthy oceans—and we don’t have time to waste.Finally, we must mitigate the damage that has already been done as a result of climate change—and prepare for sea level rise, droughts, and extreme weather events. Disaster assistance must be distributed equitably, and we must ensure that everyone gets the help they need.On day one of my presidency, I\\'ll end all new fossil fuel leases offshore and on public lands—and phase out all existing offshore drilling. I\\'m committed to leaving no worker behind as we transition to clean energy, and will focus on transitioning workers to offshore wind energy.I’ll work to reduce marine plastic pollution and ocean trash. And I\\'ll hold Big Ag accountable for polluting our oceans and waterways, which has exacerbated toxic algal blooms, harmed marine life, and contaminated our drinking water.Coastal and marine habitats are our best natural defense system in the fight against climate change, storing more carbon than tropical forests and acting as cheaper and more effective sea walls. My administration will restore marine ecosystems and expand marine protected areas.As we transition our economy to 100% clean energy, my administration will prioritize offshore renewable energy. I\\'ll fight to fully restore America\\'s fish stocks—supporting up to 500k additional jobs—and invest in regenerative ocean farming that will help fight climate change.Climate change has pushed our oceans to the brink. By restoring our oceans and rebuilding our blue economy, we can create good, high-paying union jobs, protect a crucial source of food, and fight climate change.We need a #GreenNewDeal to fight the climate crisis—and we need a #BlueNewDeal to protect and restore our oceans so they are a part of our climate solution, and so we can rebuild our blue economy.

And we can pay for it all with my #WealthTax.Giant companies are raking in profits while squeezing working families to the breaking point. It\\'s time to put more power in the hands of workers. My plan ensures that the 27 million part-time workers in America are treated with respect and can build a future for their families.And it\\'s time to remove the perverse incentives that keep giant corporations from making their workers full-time. I\\'ll extend leave and benefit protections to part-time workers, and require employers to offer additional hours to existing part-time workers before hiring new ones.My plan will give workers who work at companies with more than 15 employees the rest they desperately need by guaranteeing workers 11 hours between shifts and compensating them with higher pay for hours voluntarily worked within that window.Under my Fair Workweek Plan, employers with 15 or more employees will be required to give two weeks’ advance notice of work schedules. And employees will be empowered to ask for schedules that work for them, without fear of retaliation.These unpredictable schedules make it nearly impossible to work another job, go back to school, or schedule child care. And workers of color—especially women of color—bear the brunt of these abusive scheduling practices.Millions of workers face unpredictable schedules that can change dramatically day-to-day—even by the hour—with almost no advance warning. A third of workers involuntarily work part-time because they aren\\'t assigned enough hours by giant corporations trying to keep costs down.As corporations rake in larger profits, working families across the country are getting crushed by rising costs and wages that are barely budging. Adding to their challenges, many employers—especially in the retail and service industries—are using algorithms to assign schedules.Unpredictable work schedules are leaving too many part-time workers with no control over their time and not enough hours to make ends meet. My Fair Workweek Plan will put power in the hands of part-time workers and help them control their schedules. https://t.co/z15jWSK8OQOur government and our economy are working great for the wealthy and the well-connected, but not so great for everyone else.

Then one of the boys spotted her coming up the walk with Uncle Crowbar (that name is another story).Thanksgiving dinner was set for noon, and most of the family was there by mid-morning. The table was set. The sweet potato casseroles were out of the oven. The pies were on display. The Jell-O molds were out on special plates. Food was piled everywhere. But—no Aunt Max.Aunt Max was funny and quick-talking. She never took anything too seriously, including time. And she wasn’t much of a cook, so the other sisters made sure that she was up to the task—peppering her with questions, making sure she\\'d get a big enough turkey.Thanksgiving was always a big gathering in our family. The holiday brought in family from Texas, Arkansas, and Kansas. That meant LOTS of planning over who would bring what, how much, and so on.\\n\\nOne year, Aunt Max, my mother’s oldest sister, volunteered to bring the turkey. https://t.co/7VS3mDxfSgI\\'m heartsick for Jesus Martinez Manon and his family. We must end this cruelty. No family should live in fear of having their loved ones torn away from them—on Thanksgiving or any day. When I\\'m president, we\\'ll build a humane immigration system and treat immigrants with dignity. https://t.co/kWPXqr5ipBThis year, I\\'m grateful for my family, for the incredible opportunities I\\'ve had, for the many wonderful people I’ve met, and for the grassroots movement that is fighting alongside me. From my family to yours: Happy Thanksgiving!We\\'re so grateful for everyone who does necessary work over the holidays to keep us safe and healthy. But too many giant corporations shamefully choose profits over people by staying open on Thanksgiving. Retail workers deserve to spend time with their loved ones, too. https://t.co/rcTY1fT4iPI told @IAForWarren that if it’s a fight between money and the power of a grassroots movement, I\\'m betting on the people. https://t.co/q1XZNxenCGThis is appalling. Our government has a basic responsibility to protect its citizens from dangerous workplaces—not bend over backwards to absolve and protect giant corporations. Phillip Lee Terry and his family deserve justice. https://t.co/m3uE8thUF6Thank you @BlackWomxnFor and @MsPeoples for joining me in Atlanta last week. I\\'ll fight shoulder to shoulder with you to put power and resources in the hands of the people. https://t.co/qGO8PeYZQ4Governor Northam, you have the opportunity to empower unions and working families. You should take it. https://t.co/laaNjR2yzbI\\'m so grateful for Amber Torres\\'s support and I will fight to ensure the United States meets its trust and treaty obligations. https://t.co/t50J8ixOIeThis is cruel and appalling. These students simply dreamed of getting the high-quality higher education America can offer. ICE deceived and entrapped them, just to deport them. https://t.co/t6kQLiV5ohI\\'m proud to stand alongside @Deb4CongressNM in the fight to ensure that the United States honors its promises and commitments to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples. https://t.co/qjTZybxL37At its best, America is a place for big dreams and second chances. That’s what I’ve always fought for, and that’s the America I want us to build together. https://t.co/j42UClCodhThe Trump administration\\'s cruel and dangerous policies are putting children in danger and driving families apart. When I\\'m president, I\\'ll end his racist policies and welcome immigrants and asylum seekers. https://t.co/Sm91Xp9nClPresidential candidates typically do \"call time\"—also known as calling wealthy donors and asking for big checks.\\n\\nNot me. Our campaign is funded by grassroots donors like you. Will you pitch in now? https://t.co/1tDuvv0GYuGoogle recently hired a notorious union-busting firm—and yesterday, fired four employees who were organizing their colleagues and holding Google accountable. I stand with Rebecca Rivers and her colleagues. I’ll always fight to protect workers’ rights. https://t.co/dUIsEd58jYMonopolies are bad for consumers and our economy—and they\\'re bad for employees, too.\\n\\nBut when workers build a grassroots movement and fight together to hold Big Tech companies like Amazon accountable, they can win. https://t.co/XQ1Iku6zppDream big, fight hard, put on your sweatshirt, and let’s get to work! https://t.co/JP6wo9OkNpYup, I’m tired of “Woe Is Me” billionaires too, @TrevorNoah. My #WealthTax will help families afford child care, college, and free an entire generation from student loan debt—and the billionaires will be just fine. https://t.co/JrkfTPqkt8Some billionaires figured it might be cheaper to run for president than pay my #WealthTax. Well they don’t have the power of a grassroots movement—and in our democracy, I believe in the power of people over money. https://t.co/tDo1Rjg4WMFighting for the #GreenNewDeal isn\\'t just about fighting climate change. It\\'s a commitment to building a better future for the working people of our country by creating millions of good union jobs. We can’t fight climate change with a low-wage economy.We need to build a new farm economy that is truly open to all. I’ve listened to Black farmers and updated my plan to reflect their experiences. We must root out structural racism to ensure Black farmers succeed. https://t.co/Y9AUKDxHDyWe need bold action now to pass the #GreenNewDeal, build a green new economy, and defeat the climate crisis—and I\\'ve got a plan for that. I\\'m proud to work alongside groups like @SunriseMvmt to build the grassroots movement we need to fight climate change. https://t.co/GHJKDCloowAfter my daddy\\'s heart attack, he couldn\\'t work for a while. So my mother got a minimum wage job—and that job saved our house. She was scared, but she found the strength to do what needed to be done to save our family. https://t.co/oeMFWT4Jq5I’ve got a lot of plans to bring big, structural change to Washington. But first, there\\'s one plan that makes it all possible: Making sure we hit our monthly fundraising goals.\\n\\nCan I count on you to pitch in to our grassroots movement before midnight? https://t.co/W0M93uwDUUPrivate companies shouldn\\'t be able to profit off of incarcerated people by charging them to read a book or video call their family. My plan for criminal justice reform will rein in this exploitation. https://t.co/WY2oZ41229I\\'ve proposed the biggest and most progressive increase in Social Security benefits in nearly half a century—an immediate $200 monthly increase.

That\\'s why I\\'m investing in meeting thousands of voters, taking over 85,000 selfies, and building a grassroots movement that will fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/DZftlFvyqiExperts agree: Broad student debt cancellation would supercharge economic growth by freeing a generation crushed by debt. Candidates who oppose it should explain why punishing young people matters more than promoting home ownership and business creation. https://t.co/9UUPYUYWYEWe need public financing of our elections. But manipulating the rules to attack @WorkingFamilies and push them off the ballot is wrong. https://t.co/2XKWwUZj8vThe same communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution are also on the front lines of the climate crisis—and extreme weather events could put them at even greater risk. We have to end the climate crisis and clean up Superfund sites. https://t.co/YfFmb6H16SI\\'m in this fight because I want our kids to have a brighter future.

I’m so proud to be fighting alongside you for big, structural change. https://t.co/Ob3pfPKqfXFor months, the people of Hong Kong have taken to the streets to stand up for their rights. This weekend, they went to the ballot box and sent the powerful message that they want to keep their democracy—and Beijing must respect that. https://t.co/tEvUKsz0zuLet’s be clear: Our government criminalizes too many things and sends too many people to jail. In a Warren administration, we will: \\n\\n☑️ Repeal the 1994 Crime Bill \\n☑️ Legalize marijuana\\n☑️ Undo the legacy of the War on Drugs\\n☑️ End cash bail and private prisonsHistory has proven that when working women fight together, they win. The Black women of the Atlanta Washerwomen Strike show the true story of American persistence. https://t.co/9ht7ophMNxThere have been 2,302 mass shootings in the United States since Sandy Hook. We shouldn\\'t have to live like this. But unless we root out corruption in Washington, the gun lobby will always have a veto on any legislation to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/QPx0DtRGIAI support the students, organizers, and activists demanding accountability on climate action and more at #HarvardYale. Climate change is an existential threat, and we must take bold action to fight this crisis. https://t.co/lm1V6honI4My heart is with @LucyMcBath today. Jordan Davis should be alive. We must call out the fact that Black Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy in our country. I promise to fight my heart out—for justice for Jordan, and to end this epidemic. https://t.co/XbUxZTwpz9I’m glad everyone is enjoying the Bailey photos we sent out yesterday!\\n\\nFor more updates from our grassroots campaign (and maybe more photos in the future), add your name: https://t.co/5lxWK3Lvoi https://t.co/x27J367k7kThis guy was Mick Mulvaney’s right-hand man in Congress. Now, he has a plum job as a payday loan lobbyist and is cozying up to Mulvaney to advance his clients’ interests.\\n\\nIn a Warren administration, we’ll stand up to lobbyists and the predatory loan industry. https://t.co/ShreGlDn4L@maddygunawan It was great meeting you, Maddy. Thanks for being in this fight!Mike Bloomberg is placing $34 million in TV ads in one week—the most of any presidential candidate in history.\\n\\nThat’s one way to pay less under my #WealthTax. Because in a Warren administration, he and his billionaire friends would finally have to pay their fair share. https://t.co/qWHtk37zaMI’m grateful to have you in this fight, @bjoewolf. Together, we’ll keep fighting to end the gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/eCDVw2PcysUnlike other candidates, I don’t host fancy fundraisers, I don’t take money from PACs, and I don’t cozy up to billionaires.\\n\\nInstead, small-dollar donors are the backbone of our grassroots campaign. Donate whatever you can now, and join the fight! https://t.co/EBLSASRJNBDonald Trump is a walking, talking conflict of interest. It should be illegal for a president to twist the rules of our government to make themselves richer. Under my anti-corruption bill—the biggest since Watergate—it would be. https://t.co/icKIZvutSv.@JayInslee is exactly right. The Keystone XL pipeline is a harmful project that locks us into further dependence on some of the dirtiest fossil fuels on the planet.

I’m grateful for our thoughtful conversation yesterday about how we can keep moving our country forward. https://t.co/Wl9Mx8Tg7dI’m inspired by the people of Nashville who are building a grassroots movement to ban private prisons from their community. In a Warren administration, we’ll ban them at the federal level. https://t.co/YbhoGdegAxIt should be quick and easy to join a union.

Big structural change can\\'t wait, and we\\'ll fight for it—together. https://t.co/ZnI2xat8xNThis cruel, unnecessary policy will put asylum seekers at risk.

We must be honest about our history, and do what’s right so that our nation can begin to heal. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Lsl47JezpMWhite supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair. Now more than ever, all of us must embrace the lessons of Black history to confront this challenge. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/iPVwOk33HIRacism props up the rich and powerful, leaving them free to take more power for themselves. And the rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power.

But the washerwomen were not afraid. Dorothy Bolden was not afraid. I am not afraid. And you can\\'t be afraid, either.  #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/RYKhpwItnY@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams From the boldness of Atlanta’s Washerwomen to the courage of Dorothy Bolden, Black history teaches us that the only way to win is to get in the fight.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Dorothy Bolden showed that one very determined woman—backed up by many people across this country—can deliver big structural change.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams This isn’t about whether or not we start a fight. We’re already in a fight. This is about how we win.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams We all know—and say—the names of those whose lives have been cut short with callous indifference by law enforcement. Let’s honor Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Rekia Boyd, Korryn Gaines, Sandra Bland, and Atatiana Jefferson by reforming our criminal justice system once and for all.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams And there’s more. It’s time to live our values. Look at the four words etched above the Supreme Court: Equal Justice Under Law. But justice is not equal in America.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 @staceyabrams Voter suppression is just one more relic of Jim Crow, and we need to say so. That’s why I have a plan to strengthen voting in America. It starts with restoring the Voting Rights Act.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Right now, our democracy is broken. How do I know? Because Brian Kemp is sitting in @StaceyAbrams’ chair. And we are all grateful to Stacey for what she’s doing to make sure that never happens again in this country.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The federal government helped create the racial divide in this country through decades of active, state-sponsored discrimination and that means the federal government has an obligation to fix it. And I have a lot of plans for how we can begin to fix it together.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 The 1994 crime bill exacerbated the mass incarceration that has locked up millions of Black men and women, many for the smallest infractions.@AyannaPressley @JacksonLeeTX18 Government redlining meant that too often toxic waste dumps and polluting factories are located far away from white communities and right next to Black communities.@AyannaPressley It’s time for our government to face this truth. Time for America to have a full-blown national conversation about reparations. Time to adopt H.R. 40, @JacksonLeeTX18’s reparations plan. Time to do what’s right, so our nation can begin to heal.@AyannaPressley America was founded on principles of liberty and built on the backs of enslaved people.@AyannaPressley And now more than ever, all of us have to embrace the lessons of Black history. The rich and powerful aren’t going to just give away their power. No, if we want power, we have to fight for it!@AyannaPressley But even in the face of racism, hatred, bigotry and corruption—Black history teaches us how to confront this moment of challenge. Black history teaches us how to stand up when we’re told to sit down, speak out when we’re told to be silent, march on even when the road gets rough.@AyannaPressley The rich and powerful want us to be afraid of each other, because they’re afraid of us. Afraid of the people. Afraid of seeing us stand together. Afraid that we will take up each other’s fights as our own. Afraid that they will lose their power.@AyannaPressley Divide and conquer is an old political tactic—and it comes in all sorts of ugly flavors: Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic. It’s the phobic—that’s the key part. It’s all about fear. Politics based in fear.@AyannaPressley Today our government is working great for billionaires. Working great for giant corporations. Working great for those who cheerfully suck up as much wealth as they can, and never glance back at who gets left behind.@AyannaPressley Donald Trump didn’t create this divide and conquer system. But he wouldn’t be in power without it. After eight years of progress under President Obama, Trump’s embrace of white supremacy, white nationalism, and corruption threaten to break our democracy beyond repair.@AyannaPressley And when Black people won the fight to end school segregation and demanded federal funding for their children’s educations, poor white children got better educations, too.@AyannaPressley When Black civil rights warriors won the fight for voting rights, voter turnout all across the South—for Blacks and whites—skyrocketed.@AyannaPressley So, I want to speak directly to the question on some white people’s minds when we talk about the need to address what our government has done in Black communities. The uncomfortable question of “what will this mean for me”?@AyannaPressley To this day racism still whispers the convenient lie to some white people that if your life has problems, you should blame “them”—people who don’t look like you.@AyannaPressley Black history is American history. And American history teaches us that racism has for generations shaped every crucial aspect of our economy and political system. https://t.co/mUjJqwvwjf@AyannaPressley Racist politicians doubled down. They divided Black people and white people in every moment of every day of every life, using force, violence, and intimidation to oppress Blacks and to ensure that Blacks and whites would never come together to stand up against those in power.@AyannaPressley The law had promised equal civil and legal rights for all, and its loss was another body blow to our fragile, reconstructed democracy.@AyannaPressley In 1883, two years after the successful washerwomen’s strike and as other groups were just beginning to exercise some political muscle, the Supreme Court struck down a civil rights law that had been passed in the wake of the Civil War.@AyannaPressley But the gains were fleeting. As the idea that Black workers and white workers could make real structural change if they fought side by side began to spark to life, an evil force was once again mobilizing against it.@AyannaPressley Then it happened. The employers, the city council, the powerful white citizens—they all backed down. The women won!@AyannaPressley And when the City Council threatened to intervene, the women sent a public letter to the mayor of Atlanta and said they would not back down. They went right to the heart of the matter: “We mean business.”@AyannaPressley Black women—then and now—are no strangers to facing resistance when they fight for justice, and Black women—then and now—don’t give up easy. Even in the face of imminent violence, Black women refused to be defined by fear. So, the women of the Washing Society persisted.@AyannaPressley The employers struck back. They warned that they would use their money and power to start their own modern industrial laundry service to replace the washerwomen permanently.@AyannaPressley In the space of three weeks, 20 women on strike became 200 women. And 200 women on strike became 2,000 women. 2,000 became 3,000.@AyannaPressley One day, they had enough. It was July 1881, when 20 of Atlanta’s Black washerwomen threw down their washboards, walked away from their barrels—and formed a union: The Washing Society.@AyannaPressley By nightfall, everything was folded and stacked, ready to be dropped off the next morning when they picked up a new pile of dirty laundry. And so the cycle continued—all for less than a dollar a day.@AyannaPressley Black women and girls found that pretty much the only work white employers allowed them to do was the work that they’d been forced to do when they had been enslaved—caring for white families. Thousands of women scratched out a living as washerwomen. The work was heavy.@AyannaPressley I want to tell a story. The year was 1881. After the tyranny of slavery, thousands of African Americans came to Atlanta hoping to build new lives, lives full of promise.@AyannaPressley I’m here to make a commitment: When I am president of the United States, the lessons of Black history will not be lost. Those lessons, they will live in every part of my presidency—and I will ask you to hold me accountable for that promise every single day. https://t.co/kIhG74rLCU@AyannaPressley I wanted to stick around after last night’s debate because this city has been at the heart of America’s fight for justice. Atlanta is a city that honors fighters. The fighters I want to talk about tonight are Black women.I’ve known @AyannaPressley for nearly a decade. Together, we\\'ve fought against for-profit colleges, stood for families torn apart by gun violence, and gone toe-to-toe with the Trump administration as we’ve fought to protect immigrant families. #AtlantaWithWarrenWe\\'re live at Clark Atlanta University—tune in! #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/Tc7WIWuUukDonald Trump\\'s racist immigration policies have done unimaginable harm, contributed to several deaths, and torn apart families. His proposed wall is a monument to hate and division. We must build a fair and humane immigration system that reflects our values—and I’ve got a plan.See you soon! https://t.co/YEAPDgA6OIClimate change is an existential threat—and unless we take urgent action to end this crisis, future generations will face catastrophic consequences. That\\'s why I\\'m fighting for the #GreenNewDeal. https://t.co/zZo5yT1dbPBig Tech companies are not doing enough to protect our privacy—and they won\\'t until they face real competition and accountability. https://t.co/RQYSpZzkcKReproductive rights are economic rights. Reproductive rights are human rights. And I will fight for those rights for all people that need abortions.@horwitzben Tell Bella that I say congrats, I AM so proud of her, and I’ll fight to make sure she has no student loan debt when she graduates!Netanyahu is accused of accepting bribes, trading government favors, and manipulating a free press. Like his pal Donald Trump, he\\'ll stop at nothing to enrich himself and stay in power. This blatant corruption has no place in any democracy—I\\'ll fight it at home and abroad. https://t.co/1jSCpoUQ3SThe way I see it, this is about our values. \\n\\nNo American should ever die because they couldn\\'t afford the care they need. No family should ever go broke because of health care costs. \\n\\nWe need a health care system that reflects our values. That\\'s #MedicareForAll.Ambassador Gordon Sondland got his job after writing a $1 million check to Donald Trump\\'s inaugural committee. This is Washington corruption at its worst. I\\'ve pledged never to give ambassadorial positions to wealthy donors—and every candidate should do the same. https://t.co/kXG6jAJ34KAwood shows that when workers fight together, they can win. We have to protect and strengthen workers\\' rights to organize, make their voices heard, and hold giant corporations like Amazon accountable. https://t.co/3W6VmwyAruI won\\'t cozy up to Facebook when I\\'m president. It\\'s time to root out corruption in Washington. Until we do, we won\\'t be able to make any progress on any of the issues that matter to us. And I\\'ve got a plan for that.This is how the government keeps working for giant corporations and the wealthy and well-connected. It\\'s no wonder that companies like Facebook have been allowed to consolidate economic and political power without any real accountability.Amid antitrust scrutiny, Facebook is going on a charm offensive with Republican lawmakers. And now, Mark Zuckerberg and one of Facebook\\'s board members—a major Trump donor—had a secret dinner with Trump. This is corruption, plain and simple. https://t.co/KNUtZanylCWe\\'re not leaving yet, Atlanta! Join us at @CAU on Thursday, where I\\'ll be sharing the stories of some of the most persistent and fearless fighters, Black women who proved that when working women fight together, they win. #AtlantaWithWarren https://t.co/XDcLiZccSLTo everyone who tuned into the #DemDebate to cheer me on: Thank you!\\n\\nI’m thankful for every #WarrenDemocrat who’s fighting for big, structural change. Will you donate $3 to our grassroots movement tonight? We can only do this together. https://t.co/6Wir1mdB46The issues we discussed at tonight’s #DemDebate touch people all over this country in their everyday lives. We know what we need to do. We have a lot of good ideas for how to fix things and a majority of Americans are with us. But we don\\'t make change—because of corruption. https://t.co/JWe8vIhR7AI believe that abortion rights are human rights.\\n\\nI believe that they\\'re also economic rights.\\n\\nAnd protecting the right of a woman to be able to make decisions about her own body is fundamentally what we do and what we stand for as a Democratic Party. #DemDebate https://t.co/kDrlXSKr4ZI’m grateful to an America that gave the daughter of a janitor a chance to become a public school teacher, a college professor, a United States Senator, and a candidate for president of the United States. And I’ll fight my heart out so every kid has that chance, too. #DemDebateI just stepped off the debate stage feeling inspired. #MedicareForAll, Universal Child Care, universal free college—it’s all possible if we fight for it. Pitch in whatever you can right now to own a part of our grassroots movement. https://t.co/iJA4caumlTWe have a lot of good ideas, yet we don\\'t make change. Why not? Because of corruption. That’s why I have the biggest anti-corruption plan since Watergate. We have to have courage to tackle corruption head-on and fight for big, structural change. #DemDebateIn my first 100 days as president, I will open the doors to high-quality health care for millions of Americans. And when families compare that health care to fighting their insurance companies tooth and nail, the choice will be clear—we need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Vk4zyMns3eI’m tired of freeloading billionaires. It\\'s time for the top 1% to chip in their fair share so everyone has a chance to succeed. #DemDebate https://t.co/sWWGwxrP9yAbortion rights are human rights and economic rights. If abortion is made illegal in America, rich women will still get them. It\\'s just going to fall hard on poor women and women of color. I’ve got a plan to protect access to abortion no matter what SCOTUS does. #DemDebateWhen I found out our government was tearing families apart, I went to a detention center at the border. It was like a giant Amazon warehouse of women, babies, and children in cages. We must treat immigrants with dignity and live our values at the border every day. #DemDebateRight now, Black Americans are more likely to borrow money for college and have a harder time paying off student loan debt. My plan to cancel student loan debt is a tangible and real way to help close the racial wealth gap. #DemDebateWe need to ensure that everyone in this country has the opportunity to succeed. Here\\'s what we could do with my two-cent #WealthTax:\\n✅ Universal Child Care and pre-k\\n✅ $800 billion dollars in our public schools\\n✅ $50 billion in HBCUs\\n✅ Cancel student loan debt\\n#DemDebate https://t.co/zC1oyHtjqROur defense budget is massively bloated—we need to end the cozy relationship between defense contractors and the Pentagon, then pull out a sharp knife and make real cuts. I\\'ve got a plan for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/n4M5U2JJjNAll three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has toward military personnel and their families. And I’ve got a plan to honor our promises to our nation’s veterans, service members, military families, and survivors. #DemDebate https://t.co/pyMfCKdTgmFor decades, racist redlining practices blocked Black and Brown families from home ownership and building wealth. My housing plan helps level the playing field for families who were denied wealth-building opportunities. #DemDebate https://t.co/vb84trHx3OChild care is personal for me. My #UniversalChildCare plan guarantees high-quality child care and early education for every child. It’ll be free for millions of families, and affordable for all. Use my calculator to see how much your family would save: https://t.co/urL0bLuxrgBillionaires should pitch in a little more so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/KiAoh5H04hTens of millions of Americans have skipped appointments or medications because they can’t afford it. As president, I’ll reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower prices for drugs like insulin, lower the Medicare age to 50, and bring 135 million Americans into #MedicareForAll.I’m tired of free-loading billionaires.\\n\\nMy #WealthTax asks them to pitch in a little more, so that every family can have a shot at the American dream. #DemDebateLet me tell you what we can do with my #WealthTax:\\n\\n✔️ Universal Child Care\\n✔️ Universal pre-k\\n✔️ $800 billion dollars into our public schools\\n✔️ $50 billion to #HBCUs\\n✔️ Cancel student loan debt \\n\\n#DemDebateMy #WealthTax says: When you make it big, pitch in two cents so that everyone else can make it too. Regardless of party affiliation, our country is working better for the rich and powerful, and worse for everyone else. We need to make our economy work for everyone. #DemDebateThe way we achieve our goals and bring our country together is by talking about the things that unite us. We want to make this country work for all of us—not just the rich and the powerful. #DemDebateThe Mueller report shows how Donald Trump tried to obstruct justice and break the law—again and again and again. That\\'s what\\'s happened with Ukraine. No one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. #DemDebateToday’s hearing makes me wonder how Ambassador Sondland got there. This is not a man who had any qualifications except one: He wrote a check for a million dollars. In a Warren administration, we’re not going to give away ambassador posts to the highest bidder. #DemDebatePoliticians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many they can disqualify or demoralize.

Storming out of a negotiation may be good TV, but it undermines our interests and our long history of friendship with South Korea and Japan. https://t.co/657YKdMGyvI introduced a bill for a national ban on so-called \"right-to-work\" laws that undermine workers and unions—but Virginia has the opportunity to repeal their \"right-to-work\" law now. They shouldn\\'t hesitate to support unions and working families. https://t.co/S0IQxbPR2WWe need to put power back where it belongs: With tenants, not big corporate landlords. As president, I’ll also fight for a nationwide right-to-counsel for low- and middle-income tenants. https://t.co/iOnmwEiq7fUltimately, this is about our values. I’ve seen up close and personal how devastating a diagnosis can be—and how the bills can turn people’s lives upside down. When I’m president, I’m going to do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another family again.Finally, I\\'ll work with states to expand their Medicaid programs, helping them enroll uninsured people who are already eligible for Medicaid and helping them increase eligibility. We can cover 18 million more Americans with Medicaid—all without Congress. https://t.co/3WJst3cxgvI will take action on day one to slash drug prices for critical drugs like Insulin, EpiPens, PrEP, and more—relieving tens of millions of Americans from the crushing prices they pay at the pharmacy each month. No more cutting pills, rationing, or skipping doses. https://t.co/Qbopjkh7bHMy plan will improve Medicare for the nearly 60 million seniors who are currently enrolled, adding dental, vision, audio, and long-term care coverage. And I\\'ll lower the Medicare age to 50, giving 57 million more Americans a chance to enroll.First, my plan gives every child and everyone making at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Level the opportunity to enroll in free health care coverage through a #MedicareForAll option. That’s a total of nearly 135 million Americans who could get free, high-quality coverage. https://t.co/IWZwPfGpsw#MedicareForAll is the best way to cover every person in America at the lowest possible cost. I\\'ve laid out my plan to pay for it and how to get us there in my first term. Here’s how I would reduce health care costs for millions in my first 100 days. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmfStephen Miller\\'s white nationalism has no place in the White House. He must resign. \\n\\nWe need a president who takes the threat of white nationalism seriously. I have a plan—and I\\'ll start by reversing Trump and Miller\\'s racist policies. https://t.co/f2nvRBEPe6Donald Trump wants to divide us and pit us against each other. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who seem different, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. To take on hate, we all have to stand up against it—together.Finally, I\\'ll work to build and rebuild trust in communities impacted by white nationalist violence. My administration will work with local leaders to combat hate, build resilience, and strengthen their communities.I’ll establish a zero-tolerance policy for any federal law enforcement officer who participates in white nationalist crimes. And my plan for police reform would replace failed policies with effective, evidence-based practices that don\\'t violate individual rights.Communities targeted by white nationalists are essential partners in the effort to combat this threat, yet they often lack trust in law enforcement. Survivors and witnesses need to feel comfortable coming forward so perpetrators of hate crimes can be held accountable.Any strategy to combat white nationalist crime must be proactive, addressing racism and intolerance before it has a chance to grow. I\\'ll invest in early interventions to protect our children from extremist violence.Too often, guns are used in acts of domestic terrorism. Over 10,300 hate crimes are committed using a gun each year on average. We need to expand background checks and keep guns out of the hands of those who may be violent or who have been convicted of hate crimes.We have the laws to combat white nationalist crimes. What we lack is the will to prioritize investigating and prosecuting these crimes. In a Warren administration, combating white nationalist crime will be a top priority for the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security.We’ve all seen the consequences. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. It\\'s clear that racists, white supremacists, and people with hateful ideologies feel empowered by this president.But the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists. Donald Trump has cozied up to white nationalists—even hiring some into his White House. He\\'s made one racist remark after another and put in place racist policies.Mother Emanuel AME Church.\\nCharlottesville.\\nTree of Life Synagogue.\\nEl Paso.\\nUnfortunately, these aren\\'t isolated tragedies. The FBI logged over 7,000 hate crimes last year, and there are likely hundreds of thousands more that go unreported or uncategorized.The Trump administration has ignored the threat posed by white nationalists and violent extremists—and Trump himself has stoked the flames. In a Warren administration, we will use every tool we have to defeat domestic terrorism. Here\\'s my plan: https://t.co/Llf6CjFePgMillions of Americans are spending more than 30% of their income on rent.

Donald Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to his rich buddies. It\\'s corruption, plain and simple. I\\'ve pledged to end the practice of giving ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors. https://t.co/i4Wy86dB4TThe CFPB protects consumers from Big Banks, Wall Street, and predatory lenders. We need a Tenant Protection Bureau to enforce tenants’ rights, take on bad actors, and make sure landlords keep affordable housing available for working families.Another blatantly ideological attempt by the Trump administration to distract from its failures in the region. Not only do these settlements violate international law—they make peace harder to achieve. As president, I will reverse this policy and pursue a two state solution. https://t.co/AgkpYDY8PUAttorneys General stand on the front lines of the fight to protect access to abortion and reproductive rights—and I stand with @DemocraticAGs.

We need to tackle our housing crisis head-on—and I\\'m ready to fight for the big, structural change renting families need.My plan to rein in Wall Street will hold private equity firms accountable. And I’ll stop federal dollars from going to predatory landlords and lenders with a history of harassing tenants, forcing tenants to live in dangerous or indecent conditions, or redlining our communities.Finally, I\\'ll fight exploitation by corporate landlords. Private equity firms have become some of our country’s biggest landlords—snatching up properties, raising rents, evicting tenants, and spending millions lobbying against tenant protection legislation.We must invest in safe, healthy, and green public housing. I’ll push for investments in new public housing construction. And I’ll fight to close the repair backlog, expand disability accessibility, and for 1:1 replacement of any units that have to be removed or demolished.Next, we\\'ll tackle skyrocketing rent costs. My administration will stop states from preempting local tenant protection laws, including rent control, by denying access to billions of dollars in federal grants to states who maintain those laws.I’ll work to secure tenants’ rights nationwide. And I’ll also push to create a new Tenant Protection Bureau—modeled after the CFPB—to enforce tenants’ rights, take on bad actors, and make sure landlords keep affordable housing within reach for working families.My plan starts with protecting and upholding the rights of tenants. Landlords shouldn’t be able to arbitrarily push families out of their communities to make an extra buck, or because of thinly-veiled racism and discrimination.Stagnant wages, sky-rocketing rents, and a stark shortage of affordable options are squeezing America\\'s renting households. Gentrification is displacing communities of color, landlords are exploiting their power over tenants, and Wall Street is snapping up apartment complexes.My housing plan will invest $500 billion into building, preserving, and restoring more than 3 million units and create 1.5 million jobs. Today, I\\'m expanding on those efforts with my plan to protect and empower renters. https://t.co/IwwfY4ErtDMy plan to pay for #MedicareForAll will cover everyone, cost less, and put $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families.

But three drug companies dominated the market and jacked up prices. Now, Americans with diabetes are rationing their insulin—and taxpayers are spending billions on it through Medicare and Medicaid. https://t.co/LPsXQgOAdPPrescription drug companies\\' obscene price gouging is leaving patients without access to lifesaving medical treatments. I\\'ve got a plan to lower costs on several key drugs that millions rely on. Here are just a few examples.Donald Trump is hollowing out our State Department and undermining our ambassadors—putting our diplomacy efforts in grave danger. We\\'ll need to rebuild our State Department, and I have a plan for that. https://t.co/GhsEQtSW72I\\'m going to fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll—and here\\'s how I\\'ll get us there in my first term. https://t.co/9ETbo24Y3y37 million Americans didn\\'t fill a prescription last year because of costs. Within my first 100 days as president, I will act to lower the cost of essential medications like insulin, EpiPens, and naloxone. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmfMillions of Americans will experience the full benefits of a #MedicareForAll option and see how it compares to high-priced coverage and fighting their insurance company tooth and nail. And when we move to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll, the choice will be clear.And I\\'ll give every American over the age of 50 the choice to enter into a substantially improved Medicare program.This option will include all of the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll, including primary and preventive services, pediatric care, emergency services and transportation, vision, dental, audio, long-term care, mental health and substance use, and physical therapy.In my first 100 days, I\\'ll fight to create a true #MedicareForAll option that will be immediately free for millions of  Americans, including children under the age of 18 and families making at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. https://t.co/NjM2V8ELmf@PramilaJayapal @HouseDemocrats @BernieSanders Thank you, @PramilaJayapal. You\\'ve been doing incredible work in the House and have kept the momentum moving forward. I’m honored to keep working alongside you for #MedicareForAll!No one should have to ration their medication or skip filling it because of the cost. As president, I will act immediately to lower the cost of prescription drugs—and I\\'ll fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/fegnVaC6x6I hope I\\'ll see you at Clark Atlanta University on November 21!\\nhttps://t.co/D3N4hMN9R1This is how Wall Street\\'s corrupt grip on Washington will end. Not with a bang, but with the tears of some sad billionaires—who will still be unimaginably rich, but will have paid their fair share so America could cancel student loan debt, have universal child care, and more.Billionaires like Blankfein can say whatever they want, but I\\'ve spent my career holding big banks accountable and fighting for working families—and I\\'m going to keep building a movement to make America work for working families.One of the billionaires who\\'s so upset with me is Lloyd Blankfein. He ran Goldman Sachs while it misled its own clients in order to turn a profit, which helped create the 2008 crash. His bank then took billions in backdoor taxpayer bailouts, and no one was held accountable.On Thursday, my campaign started airing an ad about my #WealthTax. Now, some of the scared billionaires who oppose it are going on TV and tweeting their complaints. It clearly struck a nerve. But we need this tax to help working families—so we’re increasing our ad buy.I\\'ve spent a lifetime studying why families go broke—and the number one reason is health care costs. That\\'s why I\\'ll fight my heart out for #MedicareForAll. Here\\'s how we get there. https://t.co/atrX8F7nk3I’ll fight my heart out at each step of this process, for one simple reason: No one should ever die or go bankrupt because of health care costs. And when I’m president of the United States, I’ll do everything in my power to make sure that never happens to another person again.Any candidate who believes modest reforms will avoid the wrath of industry is not paying attention. So why not dream big and fight hard for the plan that will cover everyone and provide the best care at the lowest cost?The health care industry spent $4.7 billion over the past decade on lobbying. Let\\'s not kid ourselves—every Democratic plan for expanding health care, big or small, is going to be drowned in money to make sure nothing ever happens.At each step of my plan, millions more Americans will pay lower costs for care and see the quality of their coverage improve. And millions more Americans will be able to ditch their private insurance and enter a high-quality #MedicareForAll plan.By the end of my third year, I’ll fight to pass legislation to complete the transition to #MedicareForAll. Once millions have experienced the full benefits of a #MedicareforAll option and compared it to the corrupt and wasteful system we have today, the people will demand it.We will continue to move forward on health care throughout my term, including by investing $100B in breakthrough medical research and by creating a new drug development institute at the NIH.I’ll also let anyone over the age of 50 join the existing Medicare program—and I\\'ll improve its benefits and reduce its costs for everyone.This #MedicareForAll option will be open to everyone and includes all the health care benefits of #MedicareForAll. It will be immediately free for nearly half of all Americans, including all children under 18 and anyone with income at or below 200% of the federal poverty level.Next, in my first 100 days, I’ll use the same process Mitch McConnell used to try and kill the ACA to bypass the filibuster and create a true #MedicareForAll option—more generous than one proposed by any other campaign—to begin the transition to #MedicareForAll.First, I’ll act immediately as president to lower the costs of critical drugs—including specific drugs that millions of Americans currently rely on, like insulin and EpiPens. And I\\'ll crack down on corruption to rein in health insurers and drug companies.As president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s efforts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act and will protect people with pre-existing conditions. And in my first 100 days, I’ll take executive and legislative action to reduce health care costs and improve coverage.Today, I\\'m sharing my plan to transition to #MedicareForAll. In my first term, we will reverse Trump’s sabotage of the ACA, lower drug prices, lower the Medicare age to 50 and create a true Medicare for All option—and fully transition to #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/ZErB1evhnCAlgorithms are only as good as the data that gets packed into them, which means discriminatory biases just keep getting perpetuated.

I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/ZvP0ckdiS0Let\\'s be clear: This is a callous attempt to create more barriers for immigrants and asylum seekers.

And it\\'s time to show Trump that no one is above the law—not even the president of the United States.The Mueller report made it clear that Donald Trump repeatedly obstructed justice.

And if they knowingly lie, we\\'ll treat them the same way the law treats anyone who lies in court—by prosecuting them for perjury.Industry players and their allies also knowingly submit false and misleading information to regulatory agencies, giving right-wing judges the chance to later use their junk science as an excuse to invalidate regulations.Exxon’s scientists knew that climate change was real decades ago. They could\\'ve shared their science with the public. Instead, they and the fossil fuel industry launched a decades-long campaign to cover up the facts and deceive government regulators and the American people.It’s illegal to lie to Congress, to a court, and even to your shareholders. It should also be illegal for Exxon and other giant corporations to lie to federal regulators.

It\\'s only fair that he and his billionaire friends chip in to make sure everyone else has a chance to succeed. https://t.co/Fao3q4IyKxIt turns out if you\\'re a giant corporation with millions to spend misleading people on your record of accelerating the climate crisis, that\\'s exactly what you can—and probably will—do. https://t.co/gV3xIxj7wpTwitter\\'s new ad policy will allow fossil fuel companies to buy ads defending themselves and spreading misleading info—but won\\'t allow organizations fighting the climate crisis to buy ads holding those companies accountable.

I’ll honor our troops by not only executing sound military strategy, but also caring for them after they take off the uniform.Finally, my administration will invest in the VA and reject attempts to privatize it. Under #MedicareForAll, veterans will also have the option to get high-quality health care from non-VA doctors and hospitals at no additional cost.My administration will ease the transition of veterans leaving military service and help prepare them to return to civilian life. We’ll create a seamless transition from the DOD to the VA, eliminate the benefits backlog, and expand career opportunities for our vets.A Warren administration will protect the rights of LGBTQ+, women, Black, and Latinx service members. I\\'ll reverse Trump\\'s shameful ban on trans service members on Day One. My administration will protect veterans and family members of serving military personnel from deportation.We must ensure the safety of those who serve or have served in uniform. I\\'ll fight to eliminate military sexual assault, expand mental health services and work to end military and veteran suicide, and treat the opioid and addiction crisis.Military families are the backbone of our armed forces, but they face unique challenges. I\\'ll prioritize military spouse employment, ensure families have high-quality child care and education, provide safe and affordable housing, and protect wounded warriors and their caregivers.Our all-volunteer military has struggled to attract and retain sufficient personnel. A Warren administration will preserve best-in-class benefits for military personnel, and ensure we honor our commitments to those who have served.We can honor our veterans by ending endless wars, reining in our bloated defense budget and reducing the influence of defense contractors at the Pentagon, and bringing our troops home responsibly—and then providing our veterans with the benefits they’ve earned.This starts with care in how we deploy our forces. Decades of wars have sapped our strength, and the burden has fallen primarily on military personnel and their families. It\\'s not fair to ask them to solve problems that don’t have a military solution.All three of my brothers served, so I know the responsibility our country has towards military personnel and their families.

He\\'s a shareholder in Navient, a student loan company that has cheated borrowers and used abusive, misleading tactics. He even went so far as to ask how I might impact his investment in the last earnings call with Navient. https://t.co/77UU8vQE1G37 million people didn’t fill a prescription last year.\\n36 million people skipped a recommended test or treatment.\\n40 million people didn’t go to a doctor to check on a health issue.\\n\\nEven with insurance, costs keep people from getting the care they need.

When I\\'m president, I\\'ll overturn the global gag rule and protect reproductive health care. https://t.co/kpnDFOOeY3No one should avoid seeing a doctor because they don’t have insurance—or because the cost, even with insurance, is too high.

That\\'s corruption, plain and simple. It\\'s time for big, structural change. #LJ19 https://t.co/wmvvBwrh1hWe win elections when we have solutions that are big enough to meet the challenges that people face in their lives. Because fear and complacency don’t win elections; hope and courage do. #LJ19When you give up the fight on a big idea, you’re giving up on the people whose lives it would touch. Those fights are all of our fights. And anyone who tells you to dream small and give up early is not the person who will lead us to victory. #LJ19We need big ideas that can fix the challenges we face, that can inspire people, that bring people out to vote. But most importantly, we need someone willing to fight for those big ideas. #LJ19What do toasters and bad mortgages have in common? Both could cost you your home. A government agency stepped in to stop people from selling toasters that could set your house on fire. I had an idea for a government agency to protect consumers from bad mortgages—the CFPB. #LJ19Some people are afraid of big, structural change. The wealthy and well-connected are afraid of losing their influence. Some have just become so cynical or beaten down that they don’t think real change is possible.\\n\\nWell, I\\'m not afraid—and I know we can get it done. #LJ19I’m here to talk about something that people all across Iowa and all across America already know deep down in their bones: Our democracy has been hijacked by the rich and the powerful.

And there’s more fun to come—follow along at @TeamWarren. https://t.co/H2G8IHJU69I did the homework. I got the experts to check my math, and the numbers are clear: #MedicareForAll is the only plan that gives everyone in America full coverage. And we can do it without raising taxes one penny on middle-class families. https://t.co/DXGvtvhpEsA clear majority of voters support my plan for #MedicareForAll, and a Democrat who supports #MedicareForAll easily beats Donald Trump. Fighting for #MedicareForAll is the right thing to do—and when we dream big and fight hard, we win. https://t.co/lekABSS2AxI just released my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. It puts $11 trillion back in the pockets of American families, and doesn’t raise taxes on the middle class by even a cent. Here’s how we’re going to get it done: https://t.co/GnPjZA0PFTWe wouldn\\'t have gotten this far in the fight for #MedicareForAll without courageous activists like you, @AdyBarkan, speaking out and putting it all on the line. Let\\'s keep fighting—and together, we\\'ll win. https://t.co/afEQXMAJbuThe Trump administration has pushed construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite the known environmental and public health risks. North Dakotans deserve better than this. We need clean energy to protect our public lands and waters. https://t.co/kFC5PMO89vWe can pay for #MedicareForAll without raising taxes one penny on middle-class families. Use my new calculator to find out what my plan to pay for Medicare for All will mean for you: https://t.co/gJxKFloNzn https://t.co/8EBJ3ZrbtcIn addition to providing coverage for everyone, they concluded that my plan would slightly reduce the amount of money that the United States would otherwise spend on health care over the next 10 years.This analysis was led by Dr. Donald Berwick, one of the nation\\'s top experts in health care improvement who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under President Obama; and Simon Johnson, the former Chief Economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at MIT.I asked top experts to examine my #MedicareForAll plan, and they concluded we can cover everyone and give them vastly better coverage—without a tax increase on middle-class families. \\nhttps://t.co/4CZs39Xgdm\\nhttps://t.co/mFwwzCWznMI am fighting for #MedicareForAll. I have the only detailed plan to pay for it. And we are the only Democratic primary campaign that has laid out the true, full costs of any health care plan, Medicare for All or otherwise. I look forward to others doing the same.Achieving #MedicareForAll isn’t going to be easy, but I’m in this race to fight for American families. In the coming weeks, I will also release a transition plan—and I will start lowering health care costs and increasing coverage as soon as I’m sworn in as president.We cover the remaining $11 trillion largely with taxes on big corporations, Wall Street, and the top 1%—and enforcing the tax laws we have now. Add in a targeted cut to a Defense Dept slush fund and that’s it. You’ll find full details in my plan here: https://t.co/N0Ai7TayJDTo cover the cost, we start by taking the money that employers are currently paying in the form of premiums to private insurance companies and have them pay it to Medicare instead.How is it paid for? Well, if you’re not in the top 1%, Wall Street, or a big corporation—congratulations, you don’t pay a penny more and you’re fully covered by #MedicareForAll.Instead, we’re going to spend more on care itself. And thanks to getting rid of all the waste in the system, we can offer top-of-the-line care for all 331 million people in the U.S. for LESS than what we’ll pay if we do nothing to fix our broken system now.Let’s get to the math! (All backed up by independent experts and economists.) First, we’re going to rein in the waste, inefficiency, and corporate profiteering by insurance and drug companies. And we’ll bring down out-of-control costs.My #MedicareForAll plan would end the stranglehold of health costs on American families. It would return a whopping $11 trillion to families who will never pay another premium or medical bill. It would be one of the greatest federal expansions of middle-class wealth in history.#MedicareForAll finally brings true choice to the health care system. The choice to see the doctor you want, to get the prescriptions you need, pick the job or start that small business you want without worrying about where your health insurance will come from.The best plan is #MedicareForAll—the only plan that gives everyone in America full coverage, with the freedom to see any doctor, with no premiums, copays, and deductibles—so getting sick doesn’t mean you go broke. No restrictions, no surprises, no more bills.Health care costs are rising and crushing families. And a serious diagnosis can financially ruin a middle-class family even if they have insurance. We let private insurance and drug companies profit from that pain. Enough. We need a system that reflects our values.Today, I’m releasing my plan to pay for #MedicareForAll. Here’s the headline: My plan won\\'t raise taxes one penny on middle-class families. In fact, we\\'ll return about $11 TRILLION to the American people. That\\'s bigger than the biggest tax cut in our history. Here\\'s how:Donald Trump doesn\\'t want the state of New York to see his taxes—I wonder why. Let\\'s call this out for what it is: Corruption, plain and simple. Under my anti-corruption plan, all presidential candidates would be required to release their tax returns. https://t.co/0QnsObxV1rBailey is ready for Halloween! https://t.co/RY0ahHKBDxInstead of getting cozy with the rich and powerful, I\\'m on the road this week for meet-and-greets and organizing events.\\n\\nOther campaigns might take money from fancy fundraisers or PACs.

For a company like Facebook, that could mean over $1 billion.Giant corporations shouldn\\'t be able to rig the system by scooping up government officials to get favorable treatment. I\\'ll ban giant federal contractors, banks, and market-dominant companies from hiring senior government officials for at least four years after they leave office.It\\'s not just Facebook. Giant corporations regularly hire people from their government regulators to leverage their connections and use the allure of future jobs to get favorable treatment. It’s no wonder these companies have consolidated power without any real accountability.Facebook is now spending millions on lobbying amid antitrust scrutiny—and Kaplan is flexing his DC rolodex to help Mark Zuckerbeg wage a closed-door charm offensive with Republican lawmakers.Two years after serving as George W. Bush’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy, Joel Kaplan was hired by Facebook as its Vice President for US Public Policy. Since he was hired, Facebook spent over $71 million on lobbying—nearly 100 times what it had spent before Kaplan joined.Giant market-dominant companies like Facebook, Pfizer, and Comcast strategically hire senior government officials who can leverage their contacts for corporate gain. If we want to root out Washington corruption, that must end—and I\\'ve got a plan. https://t.co/MYVntHdr6uI\\'m not taking a dime from federal lobbyists, corporate PACs, or PACs of any kind—because our campaign is powered by the people, not special interest groups with Big Money to spend.\\n\\nChip in now and I might just call with a big “Thank you!” https://t.co/D4ekFI5mpTI\\'m grateful down to my toes for your support, @johnlegend!

My plan makes big, structural changes that would help give every student the resources that they need to thrive.We must stop the privatization of public schools. My administration will end federal funding for the expansion of charter schools, ban for-profit charter schools, and ensure existing charter schools are held to the same level of transparency and accountability as public schools.My administration will work with states to sustainably increase the pay of teachers, paraprofessionals, school staff, and school leaders, and ensure that they have the resources they need. And I\\'ll strengthen their ability to organize and bargain collectively.I will also push to cancel all existing student meal debt and increase federal funding to school meal programs so that students everywhere can get free and nutritious school meals.I\\'ll ensure that every student has the opportunity to learn in a welcoming and safe public school. That\\'s why my administration will eliminate high-stakes testing, invest in evidenced-based school safety, and end zero-tolerance discipline policies.My administration will also protect the rights of students with disabilities, LGBTQ+ students, English Language Learners, and immigrant students and their families so that every kid has access to a high-quality public education.Integrated schools improve educational outcomes for students of all races. And integrated schools are demanded by our Constitution. My administration will fund integration efforts, strengthen Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and robustly enforce it.And we\\'ll provide more funding for IDEA grants, repairing and improving school facilities and infrastructure, developing sustainable community schools, and providing grants to public schools for the programs and resources that are most important to their students.Next, I\\'ll make sure that we fund schools adequately and equitably by quadrupling Title I funding—investing an additional $450 billion over the next 10 years—and working with public education leaders and school finance experts to ensure that this money is allocated equitably.I’ll start—as I promised in May—by replacing Betsy DeVos with a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher, believes in public education, and will listen to our public school teachers, parents, and students.Funding for public schools is inadequate and inequitable, and our schools are more segregated now than decades ago. We don\\'t treat teachers and staff like professionals, and we\\'re diverting money from public schools. It\\'s time to live up to our promise of a good public education.I attended and taught at America’s public schools, and I believe in them.

Big pharmaceutical companies pumped 13 million prescription pills into the small town of Kermit, West Virginia. During that time these companies made $17 billion shipping opioids to West Virginia. #DemDebate https://t.co/yciKo8hXrmThe gun violence epidemic isn’t one and done. We have been so close to getting something done for years. We must attack the corruption and get rid of the filibuster—or else the gun lobby will always have a veto over gun legislation. #DemDebateWe need to get our troops out of Syria, but we need to do it the right way. Donald Trump has sucked up to dictators, cut and run on our allies, and worsened a humanitarian crisis in Syria. We need a president who makes our country and the world safer. #DemDebateHere’s how I see it: If you make it to the top 0.1%, then pitch in two cents so that every kid in America has a fighting chance. My #UltraMillionaireTax would mean #UniversalChildCare, free public college, a raise for child care workers—and a whole lot more. #DemDebateTaxing income isn’t going to get you where you need to be like taxing wealth will. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. As Democrats, we succeed when we dream big and fight hard—not when we think small and give up. #DemDebateWith a two-cent tax on the richest top 0.1% of households, we’d have enough to pay for #UniversalChildCare, provide universal free public college, put $50 billion into HBCUs, cancel student loan debt for 95% of the people who have it, and more. #DemDebateWe’re all looking forward to strengthening America\\'s middle class. It’s why I have a new plan for expanding Social Security—starting with an extra $200 a month that will lift millions of seniors out of poverty. #DemDebate https://t.co/bxQxJQ9pIgWe’ve had a lot of problems losing jobs. The reason is bad trade policy and giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to American workers. They’re only loyal to their own bottom line. I have a plan to fix that. #DemDebate https://t.co/0ZKV17iAbDI spent most of my career studying one question: Why do hardworking people go broke? One of the major causes is the cost of health care. The problem we’ve got right now is the overall cost of health care. We must stop Americans from going bankrupt from health care. #DemDebateLet’s be clear: Whenever someone hears the term “Medicare for all who want it,” it really means “Medicare for all who can afford it.” #MedicareForAll is the gold standard—that’s how we make sure everyone gets health care. #DemDebateI have made clear what my principles are on #MedicareForAll: Costs will go up for the wealthy and big corporations, and for hardworking middle class families, costs will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families. #DemDebateWe took a constitutional oath: No one is above the law, and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that Donald Trump—and future presidents—won’t be able to break the law over and over again without consequences. #DemDebateSometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. That’s the case with this impeachment inquiry. When the Mueller report came out, I read all 448 pages. When I got to the end, it became clear: This president obstructed justice, and did it repeatedly. #DemDebateTwo years ago, #MeToo started a movement—millions spoke out and shared their stories. I\\'m fighting for an America where survivors receive the care they need, perpetrators are held accountable, and we can all be safe. https://t.co/LwkiDsO7y5It was so great to meet Gabrielle Marie Perez and Geisel Dieguez, who won the @TeamWarren contest to join me at tonight\\'s #DemDebate!

If we want to make big, structural change, we\\'ve got to get big money out of politics. And I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/X2iuUDPSn3 https://t.co/Eq7iYmNr3AThis is about more than just one phone call. It’s about a concerted effort by Donald Trump and those around him to abuse our diplomatic relationships for his personal political gain. He must be impeached—and everyone involved must be held accountable. https://t.co/PrcDJqhYgmWe’re getting closer and closer to a big milestone: Two million grassroots donations.\\n\\nWill you chip in $3 to our grassroots campaign? https://t.co/Nc1SEIYJPfFacebook shouldn\\'t be intimidated into allowing lies and propaganda to be promoted on their website—and no private company should have this much power in the first place. We need to #BreakUpBigTech. https://t.co/EwCPbaGpiBI\\'ll prohibit campaign donations and political spending from being a consideration in the selection of an ambassador. I\\'ll also ban corporations and lobbyists from donating to inaugural committees and place contribution limits on donations. Read more here: https://t.co/wtT7JacMpxTrump may think a big campaign check qualifies someone to represent our country abroad—but I don’t. I\\'ve pledged to not participate in the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors. And my new plan to get big money out of politics goes further.Lynda Blanchard, David Melech Friedman, Robert Kohorst, John Rakolta, Carla Sands, Jeffrey Ross Gunter, Jamie McCourt, and George Glass became ambassadors after they, or their associates, gave a combined $1.63 million.Don Tapia, a former electrical product company chairman, was nominated to be our ambassador to Jamaica—a country he had not visited for about 20 years—after donating $100,000 to Trump’s inauguration. https://t.co/v7xv1pmDkvTrump nominated Kelly Knight Craft, a “gold-level” member at Trump’s hotels and whose husband donated $1 million to Trump’s inauguration, as our ambassador to Canada. She spent more than half of her time outside Canada, so Trump rewarded her by nominating her to be UN ambassador. https://t.co/TEW7Hsp0OfDoug Manchester, a real estate executive who was accused of inappropriate behavior with female employees working for the newspaper he owned, donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. His nomination for ambassador to the Bahamas is still pending. https://t.co/01utObUkpkRobert “Woody” Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets who participated in a tax scheme that cost the U.S. Treasury an estimated $300 million, donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. He’s currently the ambassador to the United Kingdom. https://t.co/JwAkYvWBa4Gordon Sondland, Donald Trump’s ambassador to the EU, who was blocked from testifying before Congress last week, got his job after donating $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee. https://t.co/7FWVIgH7pkHere are just a few of Trump’s unqualified ambassador-donors. Together, these wealthy donors gave an average of nearly $450,000 to Trump’s Inaugural committee—which is now under federal investigation.For decades, administrations of both political parties appointed big donors as ambassadors. They\\'re usually not experts in the country, foreign policy—or anything else relevant to the job. But Donald Trump perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons.I don\\'t spend call time asking rich donors to throw big dollar fundraisers or underwrite my campaign. My call time is spent with grassroots donors, thanking them for chipping in whatever they can. Mind if I make just a few more? https://t.co/TDo9EkNpA1Our democracy shouldn’t be bought and paid for by the wealthy and powerful. It belongs to all of us. Getting big money out of politics is a critical part of fighting corruption and making the big, structural change that we need.Finally, we need to put power back in the hands of the people. So I will establish a public financing program that would give a 6-1 match for small dollar contributions to candidates and parties. And I\\'ll lower the limits for how much individuals can contribute to campaigns.We need to expand disclosure of fundraising and spending. The system of money for influence is helped at every stage by secrecy. We need to require additional disclosures by presidential campaigns, update laws for online political advertising, and bring dark money into the light.I\\'ll start by ending the corrupt system of money for influence. We must pass a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court’s disastrous decisions in Citizens United and Buckley v. Valeo. But we can and must also pass new campaign finance laws to shut down corruption.This is a start, but voluntary changes aren’t going to be enough to clean up the corruption in our elections. That’s why when I’m president, I’ll implement a comprehensive plan to permanently eliminate big money from our politics and return our democracy to the people.Voters have a right to know who is buying access and recognition with the possible future leaders of our party—and how much it costs. So I’m also calling on every candidate in this race to disclose any donor or fundraiser who has a special title on their campaign.Today, I’m announcing that in addition to these policies, I’m not going to take any contributions over $200 from executives at big tech companies, big banks, private equity firms, or hedge funds. My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign.My campaign doesn’t take money from federal lobbyists or PACs, and I don\\'t take contributions over $200 from fossil fuel or big pharma executives. No call time with rich donors or giving them special access. And when I’m the Democratic nominee, that won\\'t change.Corruption in Washington is holding back progress—and much of it is perfectly legal thanks to the Supreme Court. It’s time to get big money out of politics and put power back in the hands of the people—and I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/wtT7JacMpxEdith Espinal has lived in the United States for decades, raising a family and building a community.

It\\'s time to hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable—add your name if you agree: https://t.co/Z9DNwPNaTHThe Trump campaign is currently spending $1 million a *week* on ads including ones containing known lies—ads that TV stations refuse to air because they’re false. Facebook just takes the cash, no questions asked. https://t.co/3gDD6ILJpyOnce again, we’re seeing Facebook throw its hands up to battling misinformation in the political discourse, because when profit comes up against protecting democracy, Facebook chooses profit.Facebook holds incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. They’ve decided to let political figures lie to you—even about Facebook itself—while their executives and their investors get even richer off the ads containing these lies.We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook’s ad platform to see if it’d be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. Take a look: https://t.co/7NQyThWHgOFacebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies—explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.

If companies want to come sell stuff here, then they must meet our standards: Labor standards, environmental standards, and human rights standards to protect LGBTQ+ communities. #EqualityTownHallI strongly support teaching children about gender identity. We live in a world with a lot of different folks who look different, sound different, and who form different families. As Americans, we should look at this and see this as our strength. #EqualityTownHallI was glad to answer Jacob’s question. I promised him: When I’m president, we’ll have a Secretary of Education who believes in the value of every one of our kids, and who will enforce our civil rights laws to make kids like him feel safe in school. #EqualityTownHallWe believe that equal means equal. I say it because I want Republicans to hear that. I want them to know that people vote based on LGBTQ+ issues. We’ll push Mitch McConnell right now—but my main goal is that he’s not the Majority Leader come January 2021. #EqualityTownHallI will #SayTheirNames. I will fight to end this epidemic. I will celebrate and uplift the voices of the many transgender people who are persisting and succeeding in spite of injustice. And I\\'ll fight to ensure that every LGBTQ+ person has the opportunity to thrive.We need a president who will #SayTheirNames and fight to end this epidemic. We must ensure that trans women of color—and all LGBTQ+ people—aren\\'t just safe from violence and discrimination, but also have every opportunity to thrive and succeed.At the last LGBTQ+ forum, I read the names of 18 Black trans women who had been killed in 2019.

But that progress is already under attack, and the path to full equality is far from over. I\\'ll fight alongside organizers and movement leaders until every LGBTQ+ person can thrive free from discrimination. https://t.co/oEBHWVE2UbThe path to LGBTQ+ equality is far from over, but shoulder to shoulder, I’ll fight alongside the leaders and organizers who have been at the helm from the very beginning. Because when we organize together, when we fight together, and when we persist together—we can win.At least 19 trans people have been killed just this year—almost all of whom were Black trans women. I will create a new grant program within the Office of Violence Against Women to channel resources to organizations by and for trans people to end this crisis.The Trump administration has sought to roll back protections for LGBTQ+ people around the world. In my administration, it will end. I\\'ll protect LGBTQ+ asylum seekers and put the full muscle of the State Department behind protecting human rights for LGBTQ+ people globally.As president, I’ll fight to make sure that every LGBTQ+ person can get the equitable, gender-affirming health care they need. That means #MedicareForAll. And I’ll immediately work to repeal the Trump administration\\'s efforts to permit discrimination in health care.The criminal justice system should work to ensure safety for all. My plan to reform our criminal justice system recognizes that LGBTQ+ individuals—particularly LGBTQ+ people of color—face unique risks and are disproportionately harmed, and takes steps to reform the status quo.I’ll also push for landmark new anti-discrimination legislation to protect workers from harassment. And I am open to decriminalizing sex work. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy and are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse.Returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency, and I’ll fight to make sure that LGBTQ+ people have an equal share of an economy that works for everyone. I\\'ll take executive action to fight workplace discrimination.Like all people, LGBTQ+ Americans deserve safe, affordable housing. I\\'ll increase the supply of affordable housing and strengthen protections against discrimination. And, as president, I\\'ll develop a comprehensive LGBTQ+ youth homelessness prevention program.LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to experience a mental health problem and attempt suicide. That’s why I’ll fight to ensure that LGBTQ+ youth and families are supported and protected so they can thrive. They must be treated with dignity, fairness, and love.First, I will fight to pass the Equality Act to explicitly ban anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination. But we can’t wait on Congress. In my first 100 days as president, I’ll use every legal tool we have to make sure that LGBTQ+ people can live free from discrimination.The problems we face are deeply rooted and systemic, so this plan tackles many different areas. From health care to affordable housing, criminal justice reform, and empowering LGBTQ+ workers, I’ll fight to ensure that every LGBTQ+ person has the opportunity to thrive.LGBTQ+ activists and organizers have made enormous strides toward equality—but that hard-won progress is already under attack. We need a president who is ready to fight back. I\\'ve got a plan to secure LGBTQ+ rights and equality. https://t.co/j8pelUdSmSShutting off power will be enormously costly to local economies and dangerous for vulnerable populations.

That’s how we’re going to make big, structural change.I will also do everything I can to build our party infrastructure and strengthen Democratic candidates up and down the ballot across the country. In 2018, I gave or raised more than $11 million to state and local candidates and parties.My campaign is and will continue to be a grassroots campaign—funded by working people chipping in a few bucks here and there. Chip in if that\\'s the kind of campaign you think candidates should be running: https://t.co/KglUOMK98IAnd when I’m the Democratic nominee for president, I’m not going to change a thing in how I run my campaign: No PAC money.

No special access or call time with wealthy donors or high-dollar fundraisers to underwrite my campaign.As part of my campaign, I haven’t been taking PAC money or federal lobbyist money or giving special access to rich donors through call time or high-dollar fundraisers.Whatever issue got you into politics, progress is hard because of one thing: Money. Our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected but not for anyone else.Trump recklessly betrayed our Kurdish partners and cleared the way for Turkey’s invasion of Syria—reopening the door for ISIS and furthering a humanitarian crisis. We should bring our troops home, but we need to do so in a way that protects our security. https://t.co/YoIuHrbDKzSupreme Court justices should be held to a code of ethics—and held accountable when they fail to live up to it. https://t.co/gLg11YAUJ6As I’ve traveled this country, I’ve heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water. These communities need justice—and I will stand with them.Finally, we will hold corporate polluters accountable for the damage they\\'ve done in frontline communities and for their role in the climate crisis. My administration will impose steep fines on violators, which we\\'ll reinvest in impacted communities.But we must ensure that we honor our commitments to fossil fuel workers as we transition to the new green economy. We\\'ll ensure that new jobs have similar wages and benefits. And I\\'ll fight to protect the pensions and benefits that they\\'ve earned.As we fight the climate crisis, we have an opportunity to create millions of good-paying American jobs and rebuild our unions. We cannot fight climate change with a low-wage economy. Workers and unions must be our partners in this fight.As we work to enact the #GreenNewDeal, I\\'ll make sure that frontline community leaders who know best what their neighborhoods need are elevated in my White House and lead the way toward the big, structural change we need. They\\'ve been doing this work for decades—we should listen.We need to invest in the communities who have borne the brunt of industrial pollution and are on the front lines of climate change. I\\'ll direct at least $1 trillion to the most vulnerable communities—not just to clean up pollution, but to help them build a more resilient future.Industrial pollution has been concentrated in communities of color due to decades of discrimination and racism—and a system that puts corporate profits before people. We need big, structural change, focused on and led by members of those communities.Justice for communities on the front lines of the climate crisis must be at the core of our response to climate change. Here\\'s my plan for how I\\'ll center environmental justice in the fight to end the climate crisis. https://t.co/agB4llfPRgAfter I became visibly pregnant, I was told that the job I\\'d been promised for next year would go to someone else.

We can fight back by telling our stories. I tell mine on the campaign trail, and I hope to hear yours.When I was 22 and finishing my first year of teaching, I had an experience millions of women will recognize. By June I was visibly pregnant—and the principal told me the job I\\'d already been promised for the next year would go to someone else.Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don’t believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. It\\'s time to make sure our federal judges are held to the highest ethical standards. And I\\'ve got a plan for that: https://t.co/4Zj1qhN7eY https://t.co/gf7HMIv4P4Equal justice under law.\\nWe believe it, now it\\'s time to act on it.\\nThat’s why I’ve got a plan to hold our judges to the highest ethical standards. https://t.co/7uxUdYw66iWe need accountability. That should start with Congress and the appropriate state authorities opening investigations and conducting hearings to make Facebook executives explain the company’s policies and practices—under oath.In fact, this time they’re going further by taking deliberate steps to help one candidate intentionally mislead the American people, while painting the candidacy of others (specifically: mine) as an \"existential” threat. This is a serious concern for our democratic process.There’s no indication that Zuckerberg or Facebook executives have come to terms with the role their unpreparedness played in that successful attack, nor have they shown that they understand what needs to be done to prevent another attack in the 2020 election.Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once because they were asleep at the wheel while Russia attacked our democracy—allowing fake, foreign accounts to run ad campaigns to influence our elections.They’re allowing Trump to spend over $1 million a week right now for ads on their platform—including ones that air the same lies that TV stations won’t. Here’s an example of an ad that Facebook let Trump run despite being obviously untrue: https://t.co/sQdKCmrkOr https://t.co/2X2S95Ep0HAfter that meeting, Facebook quietly changed its policies on “misinformation” in ads, allowing politicians to run ads that have already been debunked by independent, non-partisan fact-checkers. Put another way, Facebook is now okay with running political ads with known lies.For instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about? https://t.co/KqEi8LxkrSFacebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an “existential” threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.The daily toll of gun violence in communities across the country is overwhelming. I’m heartsick for the victims and their families. We need action to end gun violence—now. https://t.co/JMm1WoQ2tKChina is trying to use its market power to silence free speech and criticism of its conduct. In response, the NBA chose its pocketbook over its principles—and our values. We should all be speaking out in support of those protesting for their rights. https://t.co/IRiIY1cgDgIt shouldn\\'t take a federal judge to force a candidate to disclose their tax returns. My plan to end corruption would require any candidate for federal office to disclose their tax returns. https://t.co/gQuvKVIQwm https://t.co/CCSBxA0P5FFor decades, the wealthy and the well-connected have put the American government to work for them. It\\'s time to make sure everyone else has a chance to succeed. We need a #TwoCentWealthTax—and more. https://t.co/8hMKeqrzLmI support bringing our troops home from Syria. But President Trump\\'s reckless and unplanned withdrawal undermines both our partners and our security. We need a strategy to end this conflict, not a president who can be swayed by one phone call. https://t.co/A6JY7viPn4These changes will allow us to hold bad actors accountable, and begin to restore accountability and trust in a fair, impartial federal judiciary.We\\'ll ensure that Supreme Court justices follow a code of ethics, too. That means that a judge accused of lying to Congress, like Brett Kavanaugh, could face a full judicial investigation. And they couldn\\'t end that investigation by being elevated to the Supreme Court.It’s time for fundamental reform. My plan will ensure that federal judges do not hear cases where they have conflicts of interest, strengthen our nation’s ethics rules for judges, and ensure accountability for those who violate these rules.And when judges have come under investigation, they can simply resign to avoid accountability. That\\'s how Donald Trump’s sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, ended an investigation into the Trump family’s potential tax fraud and other tax schemes.Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia did not recuse themselves from Citizens United v. FEC, the case that opened an avalanche of money in politics to the benefit of people like the Koch brothers, who invited the pair on multiple all-expenses paid retreats.A basic principle of our federal judicial system is that judges make decisions as disinterested, impartial observers. Yet several judges have ruled on cases while owning stock in companies arguing before them.Our legal system loses its legitimacy when the American people don’t believe that judges will be ethical and fair-minded. I have a plan to strengthen the integrity and impartiality of the federal judiciary. https://t.co/4Zj1qhN7eYWe continue to break records as our planet gets hotter and hotter. We need urgent action now to end the climate crisis. https://t.co/fjRNbD6BoeIt’s disgusting that the Trump administration is arguing in favor of discrimination. We need an administration that will fight to protect LGBTQ+ rights. https://t.co/KUf5KzWHcLAmericans will lose trust in our judicial system if they no longer believe that our judges will be held to the highest ethical standards. \\n\\nLike the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached. #ReclaimTheCourt https://t.co/YCpDMRtHeRWe cannot have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people. We cannot have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement. https://t.co/qvgZJ3uIZ6I\\'m heartsick for Joshua Brown\\'s family and friends. He bravely stepped forward and testified to bring some justice for Botham Jean, and peace for his family. We need answers—and Joshua Brown and his family need justice.\\nhttps://t.co/RKlcPkUalzI’m with you all the way!

That starts with appointing a dedicated advocate for workers to any Supreme Court vacancy. https://t.co/tmfhoF22AFGlad I had the opportunity to talk about my two-cent wealth tax in San Diego earlier this week. It\\'s two cents per dollar after the first $50 million, and with it, we can pay for #UniversalChildCare, make public college free for all, and much more. https://t.co/sLp7FEjubHThank you for taking the time to talk with me yesterday, @ChirlaFund. In a Warren administration, immigrants and refugees will be treated with dignity and respect.

Together, we’re going to make big, structural change! https://t.co/muppIgyVHDIf Facebook finds my scrutiny uncomfortable, here\\'s what Mark Zuckerberg and his team could work on:\\n—Ending his company\\'s illegal anticompetitive practices\\n—Protecting consumers\\' privacy instead of Facebook\\'s profits\\n—Ensuring Facebook isn’t undermining our election security https://t.co/KPpuIYMcOf@cate1078 Thank you so much for coming to our Washington Square Park event, Cath! Stay strong out there—we’re gonna win this fight together.Kroger is laying off hundreds of workers—after spending billions on stock buybacks. Union workers are fighting for Kroger\\'s success, but who in Kroger is fighting for workers? I\\'ve got a plan to return power to working people. https://t.co/oNqO0FOmQqWe have to end the widespread practice of misclassifying workers as independent contractors—and in the meantime, my administration will protect the right of gig workers to form unions. https://t.co/nzrNkHn1l9 https://t.co/oz7gyX5s79If 100 people died today from a mysterious virus, we would be all over it.\\n\\nGun violence is a public health emergency.

Together, we’re going to build a grassroots movement to fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/SYX9VbupD4I love this! Stay strong out there—and find joy where you can. I’m with you in this fight all the way. https://t.co/DIVuSsbJp7When I first ran for the Senate, they told me that a woman couldn\\'t win. But we built a movement, made history, and won. And I\\'m ready to do it again to fight for the big, structural change that we need. https://t.co/UUmixPPbhZCongratulations! When unions win, all workers win. https://t.co/BRJupm0N45Our government is working great for the gun industry—but not for families suffering because of gun violence. If we want to end this crisis, we have to tackle the corruption in Washington. https://t.co/q2srsSzLuGThis is a moment for American leadership. The country needs a president capable of both advancing U.S. economic interests and standing up for America’s values, not one who sees the two as in conflict with one another.\\nhttps://t.co/PB41JBvc4jTrump can say what he wants about me, but it\\'s outrageous that any president would sell out the people of Hong Kong behind closed doors.\\n\\nThe public must see the transcript of Trump\\'s call with Xi.

Together, we’ll build an economy that works for all of us, not just those at the top. https://t.co/WECcDBBXpiPoliticians are supposed to compete over how many voters they can persuade, not how many citizens they can keep from the polls. Under my plan to protect our democracy, there will be no more arbitrary voter purges. Ohio voters: Check your registration. https://t.co/CJKkwf9KlcIt\\'s always a good day to be reminded that I got where I am because a great education was available for $50 a semester at the University of Houston (go Cougars!). We need to cancel student debt and make college free for everyone who wants it. https://t.co/fHasLm0j9PUAW workers fought for GM. But who in GM management will fight for their workers? \\n\\nI\\'ve got a plan to return power to working people—and that starts with requiring large companies like GM to allow workers to elect board members. https://t.co/g52IclotIJReturning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency. My administration will protect and expand workers\\' rights—and I pledge as president to nominate a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy. https://t.co/pZGbp3Yct3Donald Trump is now openly calling for foreign governments to interfere in our elections from the White House Lawn. If he thinks openly committing the same crime will convince people his secret calls weren’t illegal—he\\'s wrong. We will hold him accountable. He must be impeached.We\\'re fighting so that our children can grow up in a better world. My job is to be strong for them—and they make me stronger, too. https://t.co/dTCPlLXtxVToo many immigrants have died in ICE custody. We need to ensure asylum seekers are welcomed, treated humanely, receive the medical care they need, and are not detained unnecessarily. I have a plan to rebuild a more humane immigration system. https://t.co/v3OZZHeGPdTogether, these changes will boost America’s labor movement, help create an economy that works for everyone, and put power back in the hands of working people.I will also remake the federal courts with nominees who support working people. That starts at the top: I pledge as president to nominate a demonstrated advocate for workers to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.Every worker should be treated with dignity and respect, and be safe in their place of employment. Any employer that fails to do so should be held accountable. My administration will expand worker protections, combat discrimination, and improve enforcement against violations.Over the past few decades, workers have been left with fewer employment choices and less control over the companies that employ them. I\\'ll reverse that trend by increasing worker choice and control, including requiring large companies to let workers elect board members.My administration will raise wages for workers and protect the hard-earned pensions and retirement savings of working people. We\\'ll start by raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour for all workers, including tipped workers and workers with disabilities.Next, we\\'ll strengthen organizing rights, make it easier for unions to assert their rights, and we’ll expand the right to strike. Unions built America’s middle class, and they will rebuild the middle class.My agenda to return power to working people starts with extending labor rights to all workers—including workers who have been misclassified as \"independent contractors.\" We’ll also extend basic protections to farm workers and domestic workers, including the right to organize.We can\\'t have a truly democratic society with so little power in the hands of working people—and we can\\'t have sustained and inclusive economic growth without a stronger labor movement. That’s why returning power to working people will be the overarching goal of my presidency.Giant corporations and their allies in Washington and state governments have spent decades systematically attacking unions. As more power has shifted into the hands of Wall Street managers and CEOs, it’s taken trillions of dollars out of the pockets of working families.Even as corporate profits have soared, working families are hanging on by their fingernails. I\\'ve got a plan for the most progressive and comprehensive agenda for workers since the New Deal. https://t.co/nzrNkHn1l9Corporate interests spent $2.8 billion on lobbying just last year. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington. That\\'s why I\\'m proposing a new tax on excessive lobbying. https://t.co/LVDdYFmWtOIf my plan to tax excessive lobbying had been in place during that time, Facebook would\\'ve paid $39 million in taxes—money that could\\'ve been directed to the FTC\\'s antitrust efforts. We have to break the grip of corporate lobbyists on Washington. https://t.co/uSnGkkAKEoFacebook recently ramped up their lobbying spending as they faced greater antitrust scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. https://t.co/cCLcKtfcV9Over the past decade, Facebook has spent more than $64 million lobbying our government against policies that protect consumer privacy and election integrity.If we want to make the big, structural change we need to break the grip of the NRA on Washington, we\\'ll need a movement fighting for change on the outside, and a leader willing to act. I stand proudly with @GiffordsCourage and @AMarch4OurLives. #2020Safety https://t.co/qgHpgGJ7xLThank you @GabbyGiffords for your persistence and your advocacy. I’ll fight alongside you for the big, structural change we need to end gun violence. #2020GunSafety https://t.co/SQcvpUlVd1I believe Washington should work for you—not billionaires or Wall Street. I\\'m Elizabeth Warren, and I approve this message. https://t.co/MSnFyiEJxuThank you, Jennifer, for working with me to help pass the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act. We need to make sure hearing assistance devices are available for anyone who needs one. https://t.co/8hN23BITOjThank you for having me, @Supermajority!

I\\'ve got a plan to level the playing field for America\\'s family farmers. https://t.co/PaaCqWV8McIt\\'s time to break the NRA\\'s stranglehold on Congress and end Washington corruption. \\n\\nAnd I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/IgiemH3aWZTo make big, structural change, we\\'re going to need a movement working for change from the outside and a leader willing to act. I applaud the work of these activists—and when I\\'m president, we\\'ll ban private prisons. https://t.co/MBKi3Zgu5MBruce, Team Warren, and I are sending all our best wishes for a speedy recovery to @BernieSanders. I hope to see my friend back on the campaign trail very soon.We can end excessive lobbying. This is the kind of big, structural change we need to put power back in the hands of the people and end corruption in Washington.Nobody will be surprised that the top five industries that would\\'ve paid the most are those that have spent the last decade fighting tooth and nail against popular policies: Big Pharma, health insurance companies, oil and gas companies, Wall Street firms, and electric utilities.Every dollar raised will be placed into a new Lobbying Defense Trust Fund dedicated to directing a surge of resources to Congress and federal agencies to fight back against these lobbying onslaughts when they occur.My tax on excessive lobbying would apply to every corporation and trade group that spends over $500,000 a year lobbying our government. If this tax had been in effect over the last 10 years, over 1,600 corporations and trade groups would\\'ve paid an estimated $10 billion in taxes.Corporate lobbyists swarm Congress and our federal departments to weaken, delay, or kill efforts to implement laws they don\\'t like. They spent more than $2.8 billion on lobbying last year alone.We have to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government for good. My plan to end Washington corruption calls for something unique—a new tax on excessive lobbying. https://t.co/uSnGkkAKEoWhen you find a good one, grab them and hang on. https://t.co/DwwvYBWogtThank you, @jvn, for such kind words! Proud to have you with me in this fight. https://t.co/ZYLChxeC3hAmericans don\\'t trust their government precisely because of this. My plan to end Washington corruption would ban members of Congress from serving on corporate boards and owning or trading individual stocks. No exceptions. https://t.co/rzyvlFd7QuFacebook\\'s anti-competitive mergers mean they face no real pressure to tackle disinformation. They won\\'t even do the bare minimum to improve transparency.\\n\\nTech giants shouldn\\'t be able to wield enough power to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/2gmiydwY76@NyleDiMarco Thank you, Nyle!

I\\'ll use America\\'s leverage to support working families, protect the environment, and raise the standard of living across the globe. https://t.co/0Doi0ijKcFSaddened to learn of the passing of Enrique Fernández-Toledo. He was a champion for Puerto Rico, especially in the island’s time of need. I greatly valued his insights and advocacy, and my heart goes out to his family and friends. https://t.co/KJhxBbKBzmImagine Facebook and Instagram trying to outdo each other to protect your privacy and keep misinformation out of your feed, instead of working together to sell your data, inundate you with misinformation, and undermine our election security. That\\'s why we need to #BreakUpBigTech.My plan to #BreakUpBigTech would undo their illegal, anticompetitive mergers. You\\'ll still be able to use Facebook and Instagram to catch up with friends and family and share photos of your dog. But they\\'ll have to compete with each other to make a better product for you.Zuckerberg himself said Facebook is “more like a government than a traditional company.” They’ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, undermined our democracy, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. https://t.co/jqQ0iLbfyzFacebook is doing pretty well right now. They\\'ve acquired potential competitors WhatsApp and Instagram. More than 85% of all social networking traffic goes through sites owned or operated by Facebook. They\\'ve got a lot of power—and face little competition or accountability.Let\\'s talk a bit about my plan to #BreakUpBigTech and why it\\'s got Mark Zuckerberg so worked up.@KHforAmerica Thank you so much for teaching me, Kirsten, and for all of your hard work! We’re in this fight together.We have to fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. #BreakUpBigTech https://t.co/c0qWuRb9NNI loved being a teacher—and I’m humbled to see some of my former students joining the fight for big, structural change! https://t.co/IXs3nSfUioWashington, D.C. has over 700,000 residents—more than Wyoming or Vermont.

We’re doing this together, Joe.\\n\\nWho will I talk to next? https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/hAuxDDHNFQ@BostonBeernuts Not ridiculous at all! Glad we got to chat.You bet. Grassroots call time is when I get to talk with voters and listen to what gets them into this fight. We’re going to do this together!\\n\\nChip in next, and I could call you soon: https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/dN5pDkFXdsHere’s the deal: I’ll be calling grassroots donors again today to thank them for chipping into our campaign.\\n\\nWill you chip in whatever you can now? If you get a call from an unknown number, it might just be me. https://t.co/YKXA66Cs51Then we have to go even further to correct historical injustices and ensure that everyone has an opportunity at a higher education. I\\'ve got a plan to create a minimum $50 billion fund for HBCUs, TCUs, and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). https://t.co/fq8TB2oGNcIf the Senate doesn\\'t pass the FUTURE Act by Monday, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges and universities, and other Minority Serving Institutions will lose $255 million of funding. I urge my colleagues to pass this bill—now. https://t.co/VlrIKVhhi2We should stand with the protesters in Egypt fighting for a better future—and we must be clear that violence and repression are unacceptable responses to those who seek to express their opinion or affect political change. https://t.co/h5pxZBghBLI had a great time in Hollis, New Hampshire today! We\\'re going to dream big, fight hard, and win together. https://t.co/idXB4alAWTI still believe Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. And like the man who appointed him, Brett Kavanaugh should be impeached.The NRA is a corrupt group of well-financed extremists who have made it perfectly clear that they will never put the safety of the American people first. We must hold them accountable. https://t.co/TvdfNGNWVzFallon, I\\'m so excited for you! Thank you for keeping our pinkie-promise and running for school president. That *is* what girls do! https://t.co/EHYww4coG5Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in living memory.\\n\\nI believe we can win the White House, and elect Democrats up and down the ballot in 2020—but only if we all work together.\\n\\nWill you donate before our FEC deadline? https://t.co/ehnnu8a7ltThat is, in fact, exactly what the CFPB is supposed to do. https://t.co/kCQBMBv1yYRefugees are fleeing violence and oppression, and our values compel us to help them. As president, I\\'ll reverse Trump\\'s cruel, bigoted policies and welcome at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term. https://t.co/YGkvciOQRnAfter the past two CEOs failed, Mr. Scharf has a lot of work to do to clean up Wells Fargo and to ensure that all of the people hurt by the bank\\'s past scams get every penny of relief they\\'re owed.

Thank you for the work you do every day as an educator—and don’t worry, those first-year teacher jitters will go away soon.I love going on the road and meeting all our supporters! I especially love when I get to do it with Bruce by my side. https://t.co/S5jmVUVNnGMolly from Maryland chipped in $15—thank you for making a difference! Together, we can rein in Wall Street corruption and make our economy work for working people. https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/N7EzmgeRxaGlad I got to talk with Athena, a photographer from Minnesota!

Thanks for chipping in. https://t.co/fZGH2s0bGdI’m heading to New Hampshire this afternoon, but before I go I wanted to call more grassroots donors to thank them for chipping into our campaign.\\n\\nCan I count on you to make a donation? You could get a call from me soon. https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/SuoMNFXJ3LIt was great talking to grassroots donors last night.

Public school teachers deserve adequate staffing, pay equity, and smaller class sizes. When teachers succeed, students succeed! #PutItInWriting #FairContractNow https://t.co/REASb2mfqrTime and time again, widely popular policies are narrowed or blocked by powerful interests capable of providing resources and information to a vastly under-resourced Congress. These steps will help break our government from the grip of lobbyists and help it work for all of us.My plan revives and modernizes the Office of Technology Assessment, shores up congressional support agencies, and transitions congressional staff to competitive salaries—so we can have competent public policy that actually holds big corporations accountable.I\\'ve got a plan to end lobbying as we know it—but strengthening Congress’ independence requires us to do more. We must invest in resources to allow members of Congress to make informed decisions without relying on self-interested outside sources.And when Congress votes on restoring net neutrality protections, our representatives shouldn’t have to turn to internet service providers to explain whether their industry needs more regulation. https://t.co/XyVEzwd9pRWhen Congress decides whether it should break up big tech companies, our representatives shouldn’t have to rely on Google’s policy team to understand the effects of technology consolidation. https://t.co/1Kmr632eNCWhen Congress debates the #GreenNewDeal, our representatives shouldn’t have to rely on Exxon lobbyists to explain who should pay for the effects of carbon emissions on our planet. https://t.co/DwcCuzTiY5I saw firsthand how this system works when I was fighting for the CFPB. Financial reform is complicated, and bank lobbyists bombarded Congress with complex arguments and obscure terms. It\\'s the ultimate insiders’ play: \"Trust us because we understand it and you don’t.\"Over the last 20 years, lobbyist spending has skyrocketed. At the same time, Congress has been starved of resources to objectively analyze complex public policy issues, leaving corporate lobbyist propaganda to fill the gap. I\\'ve got a plan to fix that: https://t.co/CA0CuaSgZKNow that call time is done, it\\'s Bailey\\'s turn to have some fun! https://t.co/NvloNuHUiOThank you for standing up and speaking out, @AmberKGoodwin. I’ll be fighting alongside you until we #EndGunViolence. https://t.co/rtdrjoBa32This is a disgrace.

We’re in this fight together, Jeff! https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/VGdNU57ZnnFeeling inspired down to my toes after talking with Emily. She chipped in $15 because she’s determined we can win in 2020 and make big, structural change—including tackling our country’s opioid epidemic head on.

I’m making some more calls tonight. https://t.co/Bam8yokJbq https://t.co/3biIj7U3ysI’m about to call grassroots donors who chipped in to our campaign today. Whether you can pitch in $1 here or $15 there, we all own a piece of this movement. https://t.co/ENsV6NybXbThis is deeply disturbing and illustrates just how urgently we need Congress to address this issue. Andrea, thank you for your bravery—I’ll fight alongside you to end sexual harassment in VA centers. https://t.co/1u1y1ttSkHI\\'m fighting for an economy and a government that works for all of us, not just the wealthy and well-connected.

It’s time for #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/rPyxFgP1OaCongratulations! When unions win, all workers win. https://t.co/QQaEIjc0PGThere\\'s only one way we\\'re raising money on this campaign, and it\\'s with grassroots donors like you.\\n\\nWill you chip in right now to help hit our goal before the FEC deadline? $3 or whatever you can give will make a real difference. https://t.co/KpBxGRCqi7Thank you, Keene, New Hampshire! We\\'re going to make big, structural change together. https://t.co/eOun5HKRkLDonald Trump is just the worst symptom of a corrupt system. The problems in Washington are much bigger than him—and it\\'s going to take big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government. I\\'ve got a plan to root out corruption in Washington. https://t.co/V7PRuuY0YhDonald Trump believes he is above the law—and he will continue to commit crimes from the White House until we hold him accountable. The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.Donald Trump solicited foreign interference in our elections from the Oval Office. He attempted to cover up his actions. And his appointees intervened, against the law, to attempt to suppress this whistleblower complaint. https://t.co/QxONB8NqCPI don\\'t spend “call time\" on the phone with millionaires asking for big checks.

Great job on #AB5, it’s such an important law that will help so many working families.Thank you for your support, @jvn! Shoulder to shoulder, we’re going to fight for #MedicareForAll. No one should be able to make a profit off of denying people health care—and together, we’ll win. https://t.co/8aF4Ut55jqI love calling grassroots supporters to say thanks for donating to my campaign. Hearing your stories about what gets you into this fight inspires me every day! Chip in $3 before our FEC deadline, and I could call you next. Let’s do this together: https://t.co/dYkHOt4ye9 https://t.co/ha0YbMoYWzNo one is above the law, not even the president of the United States. It’s Congress\\' constitutional responsibility to hold Trump accountable—and the impeachment inquiry must move forward with the efficiency and seriousness this crisis demands. https://t.co/jOeHSKshsDInsurance companies make a profit by denying necessary health care for millions of people. It\\'s not right—and it\\'s why I\\'m fighting for #MedicareForAll. Thank you for being a part of this fight, @jvn, and for your courage to speak your truth.

He was a dedicated, treasured member of our team, and he will be deeply missed. https://t.co/pFQIX9I7THNo child should go to school hungry. The Trump administration\\'s move to cancel free school lunches for hundreds of thousands of children is just cruel. https://t.co/XVs4OM2qy0Women held at Karnes Detention Center are receiving inadequate medical care—and now ICE wants to transfer them in order to detain more families.

Fight hard.The president admitted it.\\n\\nThe \"transcript\" confirms it.\\n\\nDonald Trump continues to commit crimes from the Oval Office, and the Justice Department refuses to hold him accountable. Now it’s on Congress to act. No one is above the law—not even the president.Corvias has failed to maintain the military homes they were entrusted with. \\n\\nWhy should they be entrusted with providing a hotel for @csunorthridge, especially while students face an affordable housing crisis? https://t.co/MzBrdvYzJtJohana Medina Leon and Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should be alive right now. We must enforce strict standards for medical care for LGBTQ+ people in custody. We must end cash bail. We must end the unnecessary detainment of asylum seekers. #SayTheirNamesThis \"transcript\" itself is a smoking gun. If this is the version of events the president\\'s team thinks is most favorable, he is in very deep jeopardy. We need to see the full whistleblower complaint and the administration needs to follow the law. Now. https://t.co/b56nLZZpRiAs soon as I left the @UAW picket line, I called Cynthia to let her know that I have her back. We\\'re in this fight together. https://t.co/ry7bslWusiNo child should be denied a loving home because of bigotry and discrimination.

The House needs to vote on articles of impeachment—and when it comes to the Senate, I will do what the Constitution requires.Change happens when a grassroots movement pushes from the outside, and leaders are willing to lead from the inside. Thank you to everyone who protested, organized, and asked the crucial questions to get us to this moment. This is an overdue but important step.No one is above the law—not even the president of the United States. Congress has the constitutional authority and responsibility to hold the president accountable. This is not about politics, this is about principle. We must begin impeachment proceedings.I called for impeachment five months ago, the day after the Mueller report came out. Trump continues to commit crimes because he believes he’s above the law. If Congress does nothing to respond, he’ll be right. \\n\\nWe must begin impeachment proceedings—now. https://t.co/aHbX63coJCOur democracy also depends on protecting our right to vote.

Great to see you, @CecileRichards. https://t.co/ckkYVtuk5sBefore I joined the @UAW picket line in Detroit, I met with UAW leadership.

We need a president who will be committed to protecting reproductive rights for everyone. https://t.co/O6N2q8E7kIKeep speaking the truth and fighting for big, structural change, @GretaThunberg. Change is possible when millions of people push for it—and when leaders are willing to listen and lead.

We can\\'t allow companies to corner the market on essential drugs, jack up prices, and cash in on the backs of patients.No one should have to choose between medication or housing. No one should be forced to ration insulin and risk dangerous complications. We need #MedicareForAll—and we need to tackle corruption and price gouging in drug manufacturing head on. https://t.co/yNxo7yUDriThe workers of @UAW are standing up for good benefits and fair wages—and they\\'re fighting for all of us.

Not only will your contribution make a big difference—we’ll put your name on my new online grassroots donor wall. https://t.co/eXLUwBGxlyPeople like their doctors, their nurses, their pharmacists.

I have their backs. #UAWStrike #1uI stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chicago teachers making their voices heard to demand living wages, smaller class sizes, and all the things teachers need to do their jobs well. America\\'s teachers take on powerful work every day, and we must treat them with respect. #1uIt shouldn\\'t be. We got into this crisis because states and the federal government have passed the cost of higher education onto students and their families. We need universal free public college—and we need to cancel student loan debt. https://t.co/WDM9qzc7SOThe daily toll of gun violence is staggering. We need to pass comprehensive gun violence legislation—and we need to tackle the corruption that has held up any attempts to end this epidemic. https://t.co/BpsdAsxxK6I loved going to our @TeamWarren house party in Mount Vernon yesterday and listening to what gets people in this fight. As president, I promise to fight for the big, structural changes that Iowa and the country needs. https://t.co/8EV4f5vzk6Stopped by Hamburg Inn in Iowa City for a strawberry rhubarb pie milkshake yesterday. Delicious! https://t.co/B0qMeoVuN7America has a housing crisis—and working families are feeling it hard. Yesterday at Golfview Mobile Home Court, I talked with the people of North Liberty about how we can level the playing field for all families. My housing plan makes it possible: https://t.co/2bSli41VkS https://t.co/eQlIFQIZT4Chicago’s nurses fight their hearts out for their patients. They deserve to be treated with respect—and that means adequate staffing levels. I will always stand and fight alongside our nurses. #RNstrike #1uYou inspire me, @GretaThunberg. Activists have always been the driving force behind big, structural change—and yesterday’s powerful #ClimateStrike proved that together, we have a fighting chance at ending our climate crisis. \\n\\nWhere you lead, I’ll follow. https://t.co/TTkBYxQjbMToday at the @PolkDems Iowa #SteakFry, I said what I’ve been saying since April: It’s time for us to call out Donald Trump’s illegal behavior and start impeachment proceedings—now. https://t.co/4AZQZQuM3XThank you @PolkDems for the opportunity to participate in a terrific Democratic tradition.

You and Ashlee remind me why I’m in this fight.Grateful for the opportunity to be part of @GLAAD’s #LGBTQForum. In a Warren administration, LGBTQ+ people will be able to be who they are without fear of violence or discrimination. https://t.co/alLKFFjXwaOur laws don\\'t consistently protect against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It\\'s past time to change that—starting by passing the Equality Act. https://t.co/h0SmtYNj8jEighteen Black trans women have been killed so far this year. It’s time for a president of the United States of America to #SayTheirNames. #LGBTQForum https://t.co/zQnsB939dNEighteen Black trans women have been killed this year. This is an epidemic, and we need to call it out. #LGBTQForum https://t.co/ZNSs8BvzFUI’ll be live soon at the #LGBTQForum! Tune in: https://t.co/bwHKURZks5Eight years ago, President Obama repealed Don\\'t Ask Don\\'t Tell. It was an important step towards protecting #LGBTQ service members\\' rights. But Trump\\'s ban on trans service members has set us back again. When I\\'m president, I\\'ll reverse this ban and protect LGBTQ service members.Trans women who experience homelessness are already disproportionately more likely to face violence. If Secretary Carson is not willing to do his job and protect all Americans experiencing housing insecurity then he shouldn\\'t have his job.Secretary Carson\\'s transphobic remarks are completely unacceptable. https://t.co/TT5N6abbtcIn 1974, Democrats and Republicans united in support of impeachment not out of mutual contempt for Nixon but mutual respect for the rule of law. Congress refused to be complicit in future law-breaking by Nixon or other presidents. It’s time for this Congress to step up and act.Mitch McConnell is also complicit. The Senate must vote on the bill, already passed by the House, to help states and localities protect themselves from the foreign attacks on our elections that the President has previously welcomed.A president is sitting in the Oval Office, right now, who continues to commit crimes. He continues because he knows his Justice Department won\\'t act and believes Congress won’t either. Today’s news confirmed he thinks he’s above the law. If we do nothing, he’ll be right.After the Mueller report, Congress had a duty to begin impeachment. By failing to act, Congress is complicit in Trump’s latest attempt to solicit foreign interference to aid him in US elections. Do your constitutional duty and impeach the president.Trump\\'s “metering” and \"Remain in Mexico\" policies are putting immigrant families at risk. I will end these cruel policies and ensure asylum seekers are welcomed. https://t.co/mm8StJuk3t@jensized Ha, I do! I hope your meeting went well and your plans are ready to go.Thank you, @JayInslee. I\\'m willing to do whatever it takes to stop the climate crisis—and that starts with eliminating the filibuster so that we can make the big, structural change we desperately need to save our planet. https://t.co/t50mffJPmATake any big problem that we face in America today, and you don\\'t have to dig deep to see corruption at work, holding up progress and putting us at risk. I know what\\'s broken—and I\\'ve got a plan to fix it. That\\'s why I\\'m running for president of the United States. https://t.co/GnXvf0m58sToday, my heart is with the people of Puerto Rico as we continue to mourn the lives lost in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria two years ago. The federal government failed our fellow citizens—and you bet I’m fighting with everything I\\'ve got to ensure that never happens again.Thank you @BilldeBlasio for making working families the center of your campaign. This is our moment to fight for an America that works for all of us—not just the people at the top. Let\\'s keep fighting. https://t.co/Q81RAUkzvDI\\'m ready to fight, and I\\'ve got big plans to meet the goals of the #GreenNewDeal and achieve 100% clean energy for America. https://t.co/i0zxkYpsNJClimate change is an existential threat—and we are already facing the effects. The youth-led #ClimateStrike and the solidarity strikes from groups like @AMZNforClimate show that our country is ready to fight for the big, structural change we\\'ll need to tackle the climate crisis.Climate change is an existential threat, and we are running out of time—but I have hope. I have hope thanks to the young people participating in the #ClimateStrike. I have hope thanks to the people I meet who are committed to making big, structural change to save our planet. https://t.co/nIiTmHriLfA terrific sunset, and a terrific crowd here in Iowa City tonight. https://t.co/WNLPJAJIzXSo grateful to have had @MauriceWFP with me at our Washington Square Park event. @WorkingFamilies has been on the front line of the fight for racial and economic justice, and I\\'m honored to have their support. We\\'re going to build this grassroots movement together. https://t.co/WMxCY62IZFLast night, I called up grassroots donors who chipped in to my campaign to say thanks—and you could be next.\\n\\nWill you chip in now, too? Even $3 makes a big difference, especially with our FEC fundraising deadline right around the corner. https://t.co/RiE0kuNIfmI want every little girl to grow up knowing that when they fight from the heart, they can win. And we pinky promise so they won’t forget. https://t.co/oZZ4AEuiBXOur economy works great for people who can use their money and power to become even richer and more powerful. But I\\'ve got a plan to ensure it works for everyone else too. If that scares hedge fund billionaires like this guy, fine by me. https://t.co/jhZQZyAVeOThe Trump administration is trying to stack the deck against asylum applicants. That\\'s not right—our laws and values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. When I\\'m president, I\\'ll undo his dangerous policies and welcome asylum seekers. https://t.co/9qWeHuCOpLBorder Patrol agents are not asylum officers. They shouldn\\'t get to determine who meets the \"credible fear\" standard for asylum.

An activist and librarian who raised tens of thousands of dollars to help students attend college, she was a fixture in her community, and she will be deeply missed. https://t.co/z6uNiKnC8jBridgette’s story highlights so many problems with our criminal justice system—from how it fails to protect survivors of domestic violence, to the injustice of mandatory minimums, to the lack of rehabilitative services. I\\'ve got a comprehensive plan for reform. https://t.co/4haSGX9SY3It\\'s time to get rid of the Electoral College. https://t.co/70uWdOoVBQToday\\'s historic hearing in the House of Representatives is an important step towards #DCStatehood.

We need #MedicareForAll to ensure that everyone who needs treatment gets it. #HIVAndAging https://t.co/CibmgUl73pIt\\'s time for @StationCasinos management to sit down and negotiate a fair contract with @Culinary226 workers. https://t.co/p4sFECnK9tIf we\\'re going to make big, structural change, we\\'re going to need someone leading from the inside—but we\\'ll also need a grassroots movement pushing from the outside. The selfie line gives me a moment (or a few thousand moments) to meet that movement. https://t.co/yN2J4GjC5tI\\'m so excited by all of the new voices that have joined #TeamWarren—especially @rgay. Her work has changed the way we think about this moment in history and how we\\'re preparing for the fight ahead of us. Thank you for your support. https://t.co/lhVrhc738CMy plan to #EndCorruptionNow would end lobbying as we know it.

You\\'re absolutely right—everyone should have the long-term care that they need. That’s why we’re fighting for #MedicareForAll.No company should be able to withhold health care benefits as leverage against striking workers. We need #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/8aOzW7vLOkWe have to know that when government officials are making decisions, they are considering only the public interest—not their own personal interests or the interests of their friends and future employers.

But I’m tired of being on defense—I’m ready to go on offense.

But in the aftermath of that tragedy, women workers organized, fought back, and secured major victories. I know big, structural change is possible—because America\\'s done it before. https://t.co/PPedaxnUxS@MatthewMalloy2 @claretoenis Thanks for sticking around until the end, Matt! Selfies and big, structural change—two promises I’ll keep.The energy of our grassroots supporters keeps me going. This is our moment in history to dream big, fight hard, and win. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/BE9XNaOB5xThe wealthy and well-connected haven\\'t just scooped up a huge chunk of the wealth all of us have worked hard to produce—they’ve also gobbled up opportunity itself. But this is America. We should invest in opportunities for everyone. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/FSt26GWNHqThroughout our history, Americans have been told that it wasn’t possible to make big, structural change. But they didn’t give up. They built grassroots movements—and they changed the course of American history. I believe we can do it again. Thank you, New York. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/VENIT5LuB1Women workers sounded the alarm about working conditions for years before the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire, but corruption stopped reforms. Look at any big problem we face today—climate change, gun safety, health care—and you can see the same system at work. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/5QPje4KJRVThank you, New York City! Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/gPUhszRcOlDonald Trump is corruption in the flesh. But our problems didn\\'t start with Donald Trump. A country that elects Donald Trump is already in serious trouble. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/9BYOtFmn1RThis is our moment in history. Our moment to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. But Democrats can’t win if we’re scared and looking backward. If you’re ready to join this fight, chip in $3 to our grassroots campaign. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/09hZpgXuAkWe win when we meet the moment. We win when we stand up for what is right. And we win when we get out there and fight for it. If you’re ready to fight, join me: https://t.co/QYdzoJ5Tqe #WarrenNYC2020 is about the direction America goes, not just for four years, but for generations to come. There’s a lot at stake in this election, and I know people are scared. But we can\\'t choose a candidate we don\\'t believe in just because we\\'re too scared to do anything else. #WarrenNYCCorruption has put our planet at risk. Corruption has broken our economy. And corruption is breaking our democracy. I know what’s broken, I’ve got a plan to fix it, and that’s why I’m running for President of the United States. #WarrenNYCWhen you see a government that works great for those with money and connections and doesn’t work much for anyone else, that’s corruption—plain and simple. It’s time to call it out for what it is. #WarrenNYCJoin us live from Washington Square Park tonight as I share the story of how working women organized to change the course of history—and how we can make the big, structural change our future depends on. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/LKvnA31wIhHonored to have you sing the National Anthem at today’s event. Together, we’re going to build a better future for your family and for every immigrant family living in this country. #WarrenNYC https://t.co/utp5Kmv2LiThe power to authorize the use of American military force belongs to Congress—not to the president, and definitely not to the Saudi royal family.We need to break the grip that big donors have on our government—and one of the best ways to do that is with public financing for elections. I hope New York takes this important step. https://t.co/SaOHXRxQ1bHispanic and Latinx Americans fighting for big, structural change have transformed their communities and our country—and we are stronger for their contributions. This #LatinxHeritageMonth, we recognize and celebrate their achievements.What cheering in the Quiet Car looks like. Thanks @WorkingFamilies! https://t.co/kuPZlWBlbpGrateful for @WorkingFamilies endorsement today. Together, we\\'re going to make the big, structural change we need so that government works for all of us—not just the wealthy and well-connected. https://t.co/AF9YNuUR19Together, we can root out the corruption in Washington. We can make big, structural changes that will restore our trust in government. And when I’m President, that’s exactly what I plan to do.That’s not all. I\\'ve also released plans to make sure that no president is above the law, to tackle defense contractor coziness at the Pentagon, and to expand oversight, transparency, and enforcement for all contractors hired by the federal government.We\\'ll fix our criminal laws to make sure we can hold corrupt officials accountable. And we\\'ll ensure that our federal agencies and courts work for the people. That includes holding our federal judiciary—including the Supreme Court—to the highest ethical standards.We\\'ll end lobbying as we know it, strengthening our lobbying laws and helping to break the grip that lobbyists have on our government. The voices of corporations and powerful interests shouldn’t be the only voices influencing government—but that’s exactly what’s happened.We\\'ll start by strengthening public integrity rules for federal officials in every branch of government, rooting out financial conflicts of interest, and slamming shut the revolving door between government and industry.My plan lays out the most sweeping set of anti-corruption reforms since Watergate—nearly one hundred proposals. The goal is simple: Take power away from the wealthy and the well-connected and put it back where it belongs—in the hands of the people.But these problems didn’t start with Trump. On issue after issue, widely popular policies are blocked because corporations and billionaires use their money and influence to stop any progress. To fix it, we’ll need big, structural change to fundamentally transform our government.The Trump administration is the most corrupt of our lifetimes. Trump is a walking conflict of interest, and many of his cabinet secretaries are no better. His Supreme Court Justices were hand-picked by right-wing extremist groups, and some of his donors are now ambassadors.In 2019, just 17% of Americans trusted government to do the right thing. Why? Because our government works great for the wealthy and well-connected, but not for everyone else. That’s corruption, plain and simple—and I’ve got a plan to fight back. https://t.co/V7PRuuY0YhAuto workers deserve good wages, comprehensive benefits, and economic security.

Democracy depends on all of us being willing to speak out. #WeWillNotYield https://t.co/FSl3QfZIXnThis is appalling. We must use every tool at our disposal to end the HIV epidemic.

My plan to reform our criminal justice system will empower our public defenders and make sure they have the resources they need. https://t.co/XgwsW5rRvVThat\\'s why I\\'m fighting for #MedicareForAll. So that people like @AdyBarkan get the care they need. So that Rachael doesn\\'t have to spend hours on hold, filling out forms, and fighting to get Ady\\'s care covered. And Ady can enjoy the time he has left with his family.@AdyBarkan The basic profit model of an insurance company is to bring in as much money as they can in premiums and pay out as little as possible in health care coverage. We like our doctors and our nurses—but I\\'ve never met anyone who actually likes their insurance company.My friend @AdyBarkan has \"good\" health insurance, but it\\'s not nearly enough. Every month, he has thousands of dollars in medical bills that his insurer won\\'t cover. His wife Rachael spends hours every week arguing with their insurer. That\\'s time she can\\'t spend with Ady. https://t.co/zfeasY2rVyOur Social Security system should value the work of caregiving. My plan updates outdated rules to raise benefits for caregivers—on top of immediately increasing Social Security benefits by $200 a month for everyone. https://t.co/9uKcoq4CzfThe system is working great for giant pharmaceutical companies, but not so great for everyone who needs prescription drugs. I\\'ve got a few plans to fix that. https://t.co/IqIgh3EtJ3I absolutely believe we can make big, structural changes to tackle the gun violence epidemic head on. If we turn our heartbreak and our anger into action, we can take the power from the NRA and the lawmakers in its pocket and return it to the people. https://t.co/oNOjva3Rak https://t.co/zghs1e2K1nRight now, Congress is held hostage by a small group of well-financed gun lobbyists. I will break the NRA’s stranglehold on Congress and sign comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation within my first 100 days. https://t.co/OypI0bwe6nAt last night’s #DemDebate, I made it clear: We can\\'t ask our military to solve problems that can\\'t be solved with military force. We need to bring our troops home. https://t.co/dBSr7BclP5And that’s a wrap! #DemDebate https://t.co/j9IC5zF9wWI’ve been a public school teacher. We need a Secretary of Education who believes in public schools—that\\'s why I\\'ll appoint one who has been a public school teacher too. #DemDebate https://t.co/q5xxSpSRt5My story has a lot of twists and turns, but I was resilient. I kept fighting, and I lived my dream. I\\'m standing here today because I got back up, and I fought back. I know what\\'s broken, and I want to be in the fight to fix it. #DemDebate https://t.co/HCoPl481UaWe like our doctors, our nurses, and our pharmacists—not the insurance companies. What people want is affordable health care. What we need to fight for is #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/Ndg5aId2lOI just stepped off the #DemDebate stage feeling fired up about the movement we’re building together. Our campaign is 100% grassroots funded—no fancy fundraisers, no federal lobbyists, no PACs.\\n\\nWill you chip in whatever you can to my campaign right now? https://t.co/dyWtlTxcNBI got to live my dream of being a public school teacher. But by the end of my first school year, I was visibly pregnant. The principal said, “Good luck!” and didn’t ask me back. But I got back up, and I fought back. That\\'s why I\\'m standing here today. #DemDebateI’ve proposed a two-cent wealth tax that would mean #UniversalChildCare for every baby and child aged 1-4, would cancel student loan debt for 95% of people who have it, invest $50 billion in HBCUs, and strengthen our unions. #UltraMillionaireTax #DemDebateI think I’m the only person on stage who’s been a public school teacher. Money for public schools should stay in public schools. I’ve already made my commitment: When I’m president, we will have a Secretary of Education who has been a public school teacher. #DemDebateWe need to fight climate change on every front. It is the threat to every living thing on this planet—and we\\'re running out of time. I’ve adopted Governor @JayInslee’s proposal to cut all carbon emissions by 2030, and we need to tackle corruption in Washington head on. #DemDebateWhat we’re doing right now in Afghanistan is not helping the safety and security of the U.S., Afghanistan, or the world. We cannot ask our military to solve problems that can’t be solved with military force. We need to bring our troops home. #DemDebateOur trade policy is broken because it works for giant multinational corporations and no one else. If they can save a nickel by moving to a foreign country, they\\'ll do it. When I’m president, corporations won’t shape our trade policy: Unions, farmers, and workers will. #DemDebateI want to start with a statement of principal: Immigration does not make us weaker—it makes us stronger. As president, I will expand legal immigration and create a pathway to citizenship, not only for DREAMers, but for their families. #DemDebate.I want to be as clear as I can: When Democrats next have power, we should be bold. It’s time to get rid of the filibuster. #DemDebateNearly 90% of Americans want to see background checks. Why isn’t anything getting done? Because Congress is beholden to the NRA. It’s corruption, plain and simple. Unless we address systemic problems, like the filibuster and the gun lobby, we won’t get anywhere. #DemDebateOur punitive criminal justice system is devastating entire communities. If we want real justice in our country, then we need big, structural changes to reform our system from beginning to end. I’ve got a plan to do just that. #DemDebate\\nhttps://t.co/0DWEZ9WAqvUnder #MedicareForAll, people will have access to all of their doctors, their nurses, their rural and community hospitals. What this is about is making sure we have the most efficient way possible to pay for health care for everyone in this country. #DemDebateI have never met anyone who likes their health insurance company. They like their doctors, their pharmacists, their nurses. What people want is affordable health care. What we need to fight for is #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateWhat we’re talking about here is what’s going to happen in families’ pockets. The answer is that under #MedicareForAll, costs are going to go up for rich individuals and giant corporations. And costs are going to go down for hardworking families. #DemDebateThe path to the American middle class is getting rockier. Students are getting crushed by mountains of student debt. We face an existential climate crisis. I know what’s broken, I know how to fix it, and I’m going to lead the fight to get it done. #DemDebateIn just a few minutes, I’ll be behind a podium at the #DemDebate.

We need a real plan to save our economy, and I\\'ve got one. https://t.co/YlmmBveokGLet’s be clear: The wealthiest 0.1% haven\\'t been paying their fair share. I\\'m not going to let them rig the system for themselves while opportunity slips away for everyone else. This isn’t about winning or losing. My #UltraMillionaireTax will level the playing field for everyone. https://t.co/Msj2SY2LpEEveryone deserves a decent retirement. Try my new retirement calculator to see how much your Social Security benefits would increase under my plan: https://t.co/qIL8h6Lm6OAnother big benefit: My plan will increase economic growth in the long term and reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next ten years.So how will we pay for this? Easy. We can immediately increase Social Security benefits and extend the program’s solvency by nearly two decades by asking the top 2% of families to contribute their fair share to the program.Those who face work and pay discrimination, like women and caregivers, low-income workers, people of color, and people with disabilities, have lower benefits in retirement. I\\'ll update outdated Social Security rules to ensure everyone gets fairer benefits.For the 63 million Americans who count on Social Security—including the 10 million Americans with disabilities and their families—my plan will provide more economic security. Money to see the doctor or do necessary home repairs.My plan would immediately increase Social Security benefits by $200 a month—$2,400 a year—for every current and future Social Security beneficiary in America. This would immediately lift around 4.9 million seniors out of poverty and cut the senior poverty rate by nearly 70%.Social Security has become the main source of retirement income for most seniors, but the benefits today are quite small. 14% of seniors live in poverty—another 28% of seniors are close to it. Seniors are cutting pills and skipping meals to save money. This is unacceptable.It’s getting harder for families to save enough for a decent retirement. A generation of stagnant wages and rising costs for basics like housing and health care have squeezed family budgets. Millions of Americans are sacrificing saving for retirement just to make ends meet.We face a retirement crunch that\\'s only going to get worse unless we take bold action. I\\'ve got a plan to provide the biggest increase in Social Security benefits in decades—an immediate $200-a-month increase for everyone. https://t.co/LTmK8M6E2EMy stance couldn’t be clearer: These executives and CEOs know the system has been rigged in their favor—and they’ve gotten away with it for a long time. \\n\\nThat stops when I’m president. https://t.co/MQXXxAS6UMIt\\'s time for corporations to pay their fair share and put #SchoolsAndCommunitiesFirst. This reform is long overdue. https://t.co/1osZBN3pH0This is excellent news for Uber and Lyft drivers—and for every employee who has been misclassified as an \"independent contractor\" by their employer. Now let\\'s keep up the fight for full employee status for workers across the country. https://t.co/HguIsTLhrtIt is cruel and unnecessary to separate a kid from their family—especially after surviving Hurricane Dorian. We should be protecting and supporting families fleeing natural disasters, not punishing and traumatizing them. https://t.co/1oaGphHuRtLet’s be clear: This decision is racist and cruel. We should grant Temporary Protected Status to Bahamians fleeing Hurricane Dorian. A Warren administration will reinstate TPS to protect refugees who are at risk in their home countries. https://t.co/aBObQAKA4rToday, I’m thinking about the lives we lost on September 11th and the courage of the first responders, service members, and citizens who risked their lives that day and in the aftermath of that tragedy.

Thank you for opening up your home to me and asking these important questions. We’re in this fight together.@AdyBarkan Exactly. I spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the top reasons is the cost of health care. After my daddy had a heart attack, we lost the family station wagon, and we nearly lost the house.@AdyBarkan Insurance companies. Right now, the system is working great for them. They pull in as many dollars as they can in premiums, and pay out as few dollars as possible for health care. You know firsthand how difficult this system can be even for people with good insurance.@AdyBarkan It looks like #MedicareForAll. Our current system works great for the insurance companies making big profits, but not for the families who have to fight them to get the health care they need.

I’m honored to be fighting alongside him for #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/5aJlVAkhVtI took the @TylerClementi Foundation’s Upstander Pledge, because it\\'s time to build a country that works for all of us—and there’s no place for bullying or cruelty in this fight. https://t.co/fQRgMzowHT@HalaAyala @TeenVogue It’s true!@liuba4congress @VoteMamaUS You’re doing incredible work.

That is not right, and it’s happening because Washington is corrupt. #ClimateTownHallThis is exactly what fossil fuel industries want us to talk about—they want to stir up a lot of controversy around your light bulbs, straws, cheeseburgers. But 70% of the pollution comes from three industries. We can set our targets and say no more by 2035. #ClimateTownHallYou don’t get to ruin the air, water, and soil for everyone else just to help giant corporations. We have a Washington that works great for the wealthy and well-connected. It’s just not working for the rest of us. That\\'s corruption, plain and simple. #ClimateTownHallDon’t sit around and tell me what’s not possible. Look around and tell me what happens if we don’t make change. #ClimateTownHallI have an aggressive plan to reduce our carbon footprint: By 2028, we won’t have any more new buildings that have any carbon footprint. By 2030, we\\'ll do the same for our cars and trucks.

Trump’s border wall isn’t about security—it’s nothing more than a sign of his administration’s hate. https://t.co/q6v36g0Ap2Climate change disproportionately impacts communities of color, indigenous people, and low-income Americans.

Today, I\\'m adopting and building upon his ten-year action plan to achieve 100% clean energy for America. https://t.co/NOuqrY9IEUClimate change costs lives, causes hundreds of billions of dollars in damage, and disproportionately impacts vulnerable communities. This is an emergency—but we also have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to tackle it head on with big, structural changes.People with low incomes are more likely to be entangled in the criminal justice system, and—because of unreasonably punitive and financially burdensome systems like cash bail—they\\'re less likely to make their way out. It\\'s time to end cash bail. https://t.co/RS2si51lZASurprise, surprise: Another way Trump’s tax bill turned out to be just another giveaway for his rich buddies. https://t.co/qJMDnESNq0This is exactly why fines aren’t good enough.

I\\'ve got a plan to completely reform the criminal justice system from front to back. https://t.co/mt9LMpMSDJIf the Trump administration gets its way on this, employers could legally fire trans Americans just for being themselves.

Persist!@lydiakiesling Looking great!I stand with @PPact.\\n\\nThe Trump administration’s gag rule is a deliberate attempt to keep providers like Planned Parenthood from serving patients—and an attack on women with low incomes who depend on them to get the care they need. We’ll fight this. https://t.co/9K6WJ3IhPsOur system is the result of choices we’ve made—choices that together stack the deck against the poor and the disadvantaged. We can create real law and order and real justice in our country by making long overdue big, structural change.The majority of people in prison will be returned to their communities. We should ensure that returning citizens have a chance to succeed, by reducing discrimination and promoting opportunity during reentry and eliminating needlessly punitive parole requirements.As we fight to end mass incarceration, we need to ensure humane conditions for those who are imprisoned. That means meeting basic human rights standards, protecting vulnerable populations, investing in rehabilitation programs, and expanding mental health and addiction treatment.The president can grant clemency and pardons herself. I\\'ll empower a clemency board to make recommendations directly to the White House, identifying broad classes of potentially-deserving individuals for review, such as those serving mandatory minimums that should be abolished.Our criminal system places enormous power in the hands of the state, and we need better checks in place to ensure that it\\'s just: by investing in our public defenders, reining in prosecutorial abuses, and allowing those wrongfully imprisoned to challenge their conviction.Officers who violate someone\\'s constitutional rights are often shielded from civil rights lawsuits by qualified immunity. That’s wrong—and needs to change. When an officer abuses the law, that’s bad for law enforcement, victims, and communities.Most police officers sign up so they can protect their communities. But too many people of color have experienced trauma at the hands of law enforcement. It’s time to change how we police: funding what works, and building trust between police and the communities they serve.We also have to stop criminalizing poverty. As president, I will fight to end cash bail and limit excessive fines and fees. There’s no justice in imposing high, punitive financial burdens on those who are least able to bear them.Next, we have to rethink what we choose to criminalize. That starts with repealing the 1994 crime bill—the bulk of which needs to go—and legalizing marijuana. Overcriminalization has filled prisons and devastated communities—and it\\'s time for it to end.Investing in public safety should mean investing in good schools, safe housing, access to mental health services and treatment for addiction, protecting LGBTQ+ Americans, and violence intervention programs diverting young people from criminal activity—before police are involved.Let\\'s start by reimagining how we talk about public safety. It\\'s a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration. Instead of putting people in prison, we should focus on services that lift people up and make our communities safer.The U.S. makes up 5% of the world\\'s population, but nearly 20% of the world\\'s prison population. And the evidence is clear that there are structural race problems in our criminal justice system. At every level, the system disadvantages or discriminates against people of color.The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world—yet our harshly punitive system isn’t making our communities safer. I\\'ve got a plan to make big, structural changes at every step of the criminal justice system: https://t.co/UXihPW9VJqHere’s the bottom line: If Dimon and the Business Roundtable are serious about their statement, we need to see real action. They can start by empowering workers and supporting my Accountable Capitalism plan. https://t.co/KwTN6YPmSmAnother question: Dimon and the Business Roundtable have been busy lobbying for NAFTA 2.0. Will they change their tune now and back American workers and unions who are fighting for a better agreement? https://t.co/qYYMV6jSpXJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, leads the group that put out yesterday\\'s statement. Will he put his money where his mouth is and actually raise pay for workers instead of spending billions on stock buybacks for shareholders? https://t.co/6Fccdj1nnPA year ago, I called out CEOs and the Business Roundtable for their single-minded focus on maximizing shareholder value at the expense of workers. Looks like they finally got the memo. But without real action, their announcement is meaningless. https://t.co/x7BFpBKqwJThank you to everyone who came out to our St. Paul town hall this evening! Minnesota is ready to fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/zKelQ3kro8Today at the @4DirectionsVote #NativeVote2020 presidential forum, @Deb4CongressNM and I talked about our new proposal: The Honoring Promises to Native Nations Act.

And when we win the White House, I’ll be committed to achieving that future as President of the United States.Right-wing courts have ruled that religious freedom laws allow corporations to deny employees birth control, but don’t protect tribes that object to dumping sewage water on sacred sites. Absurd. Congress should pass a new law protecting tribal religious interests in sacred sites.When tribal concerns have conflicted with corporate profits or resource extraction, tribes lose. This has to change. When I’m president, energy projects that impact Indian Country won’t proceed without consent. That means revoking Trump’s KeystoneXL and DAPL permits.In 2013, the Violence Against Women Act crucially recognized some criminal jurisdiction by Tribal Nations, and I support reauthorizing and building on it. But we need to go further and I support a full Oliphant fix.Washington has refused to fully respect tribal sovereignty in criminal justice matters. This has deprived countless crime victims the opportunity to get justice. And it has fed the ongoing epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. This must change. #MMIWFunding critical programs for Indian Country isn\\'t optional. It\\'s required to fulfill the United States’ trust and treaty obligations. So @Deb4CongressNM and I have teamed up on writing a bill to ensure predictable, guaranteed funding to Tribal Nations and indigenous peoples.Washington is failing Native communities, and it\\'s time to fulfill our obligations to Tribal Nations. Today I’m announcing ideas to ensure that tribal sovereignty and our trust and treaty obligations are binding legal and moral principles—not just slogans. https://t.co/JT3WA6uMwuLast month, the FTC tweeted and advertised that the nearly 150 million Americans who had their data exposed in the @Equifax breach were eligible for $125 each in compensation.\\n\\nNow they’re saying, “Just kidding!” I’m demanding answers. https://t.co/mAB8LaK4H1My heart breaks for Tracy Single and her loved ones.

And we will revisit that legislation every single year based on new data to continually reduce the number of gun deaths in America. https://t.co/kN5lrUWmV1Over fifty years, comprehensive safety measures reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths.

Together we can end the gun violence epidemic and make our country safer for everyone. https://t.co/NKbXCMiKDTMass shootings capture our attention, but they’re just the tip of the iceberg of gun violence in America. Every day, we lose one hundred Americans to gun violence, with countless more injured and traumatized. My plan makes big changes to address all kinds of gun violence. https://t.co/2IgQZRhNtyIn just a few minutes, I’ll be at the #GunSenseForum talking about how we can address the gun violence epidemic head on. I hope you’ll tune in. https://t.co/MbcjOsKLV1The dialogue about gun violence in America is shifting, thanks to the work of activists, organizers, community leaders, and survivors. It\\'s time to turn our heartbreak and anger into action, and take power from the NRA and corrupt lawmakers and return it to the people.And we\\'ll revisit this legislation every year—adding new ideas and tweaking existing ones—to keep reducing the number of gun deaths in America. My budget will invest $100 million for DOJ and HHS to study gun violence, evaluate the reforms we pass, and suggest new ones.We have to chart a new path, and that starts with investing in evidence-based community violence intervention designed to stop gun violence before it occurs. As president, I’ll establish a grant program to invest in and pilot intervention programs at scale.Black and Latinx Americans have borne the brunt of the gun violence tragedy. But after being traumatized by gun violence, these communities have been doubly victimized by increased policing and strict sentencing laws.In addition to ending the special legal immunity gun manufacturers have now, Congress should hold manufacturers strictly liable for gun-related injuries and give victims of gun violence a private right of action to recover compensatory damages from manufacturers.This legislation will ensure that safe, responsible ownership is the standard for everyone who chooses to own a gun. We\\'ll create a federal licensing system, require universal background checks, establish a real waiting period, and cap firearms purchases.I will send Congress comprehensive gun violence prevention legislation and sign it into law within my first 100 days.My administration will also protect survivors of domestic abuse by closing the \"boyfriend loophole.\" And we\\'ll reverse the Trump administration\\'s efforts to weaken gun safety, including rules that enabled 3-D printed guns and make it easier to create untraceable weapons.We\\'ll require background checks for the vast majority of private gun sales, including at gun shows and online. We\\'ll extend the existing requirements on reporting bulk gun sales. And we\\'ll raise the minimum age for purchasing a gun.From the White House, I will take executive action to rein in an out-of-control gun industry. Gun manufacturers make billions by knowingly selling deadly products, and it’s time to hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable for the violence promoted by these products.In 2017, almost 40,000 people died from guns in the U.S. My goal is to reduce that number by 80%. We’ll start with solutions we believe will work. We’ll update those solutions based on new research—and stop corrupt extremists from blocking action by ending the filibuster.It’s easy to despair when our government refuses to act. But we are not incapable of solving big problems. Over fifty years ago, we took big steps to make our cars safer and since then, we reduced per-mile driving deaths by almost 80% and prevented 3.5 million automobile deaths.The statistics are horrifying. Our firearm homicide rate is 25x higher than other comparable countries. Our firearm suicide rate is nearly 10x higher. Women are 21x more likely to be shot to death—most killed by an intimate partner. 21 children and teenagers are shot every day.Gun violence is a public health crisis. That’s why I have a comprehensive gun violence prevention plan—a plan to make big, structural changes to end the NRA and corrupt lawmakers’ ability to block our government from defending the lives of our people. https://t.co/fcDY6hZzdIIn America, you ought to have a chance to build a real future for yourself and your family. But in farming communities in Council Bluffs and across Iowa, that’s getting harder and harder. \\n\\nWe must invest in our farmers and our farm communities. https://t.co/f3g7iMnp3AI’m proud to sign the #DownBallotPledge!

As she showed me where you can still see the water line, I asked her why she thought this was happening. Her answer: Climate change. I agree, and I’m ready to take bold action to fight back. https://t.co/tJuN1xLKIIWatching this little girl cry out for her father is a punch in the gut. The Trump administration’s cruelty knows no end.\\n\\nI want to be very clear here: Families belong together. And when I am president, they will be. https://t.co/43fXbTt6uGLooking forward to participating in @MomsDemand and @Everytown’s presidential #GunSenseForum this Saturday in Iowa. I’m in this fight for our kids, for our communities, and for our futures. https://t.co/W1xJOljC145 years ago Michael Brown was murdered by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Michael was unarmed yet he was shot 6 times. I stand with activists and organizers who continue the fight for justice for Michael. We must confront systemic racism and police violence head on.Voters shouldn’t have to worry about whether their ballot is vulnerable to hackers. We need state-of-the-art voting machines, ballots, and election security—and I’ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/wqsr71Zu0sIt’s true—I joined Snapchat! Can’t wait to continue to connect with our grassroots supporters. https://t.co/IcPD1ddKiCClimate change is getting worse and is putting our families’ futures in jeopardy.

I hope you’ll join them. https://t.co/lmuPztbfwNCompanies that sell guns have a responsibility to the safety of their communities. @Walmart is one of the largest gun retailers in the world. The weapons they sell are killing their own customers and employees. No profit is worth those lives. Do the right thing—stop selling guns.Sometimes, companies recognize that they have an obligation to the lives, health, and safety of their communities. In 2014, for example, CVS voluntarily stopped selling tobacco products. Cigarette sales went down, and more smokers tried to quit. That\\'s progress.When I first ran for Senate in 2012, my team and I drove from event to event in a bright blue used SUV. It was great—but I think driving across Iowa in this takes the cake! https://t.co/N4yIUwsOnwCongratulations, @AlphonsoDavid!

That’s how this is going to work: You, me, and this grassroots movement are all in this together.I\\'m grateful down to my toes for all the meaningful conversations we\\'re having during our Iowa road trip. Thanks for coming out last night, Council Bluffs! https://t.co/8IjrzPSgcNThis is inhumane and will have devastating effects on the children that are left behind. Make no mistake: I\\'ll keep fighting my heart out for our immigrant communities—and in a Warren administration, immigrant families will be able to live without fear.Just days after the massacre in El Paso, fueled by anti-immigrant rhetoric, the Trump administration carried out the largest ICE raid in more than 10 years—separating families and targeting communities of color. https://t.co/6JUTO0pZknThis is alarming—but there is still time to avert the next economic crash. I\\'ve outlined a plan for how to do it. And we need to act now. https://t.co/sU9KGAn6RrMeanwhile, the potential shocks I identified are looming larger. Trump is escalating his incoherent tariff-by-tweet strategy against China. The chances of a no-deal Brexit have risen. No wonder markets are assessing a high risk of a potential recession. https://t.co/X7KPhHDzFlNew data confirmed other weaknesses too. New Q2 economic data showed slowing growth. There\\'s a slowdown in construction jobs and manufacturing job hours declined. https://t.co/P80APcbC1oWe got more confirmation of my concern that middle class families are falling deep into debt trying to bridge the gap between rising household costs and stagnant incomes. https://t.co/QzmOzqf7DvTwo weeks ago I warned about a coming economic downturn. Since then, we\\'ve already seen more signs that our economy is in precarious condition and that Trump\\'s rhetoric and actions are pushing us closer to the brink.Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump won’t act—but we will. Together, we can stand up to the NRA and demand real gun reform to keep our communities safe. https://t.co/uKdkOeqI60I’m inspired by every activist making their voice heard in El Paso today. We are #ElPasoStrong—and ready to tackle gun violence and white supremacy head-on. https://t.co/gMoRmdP3K1Amazon is using its monopoly in online sales to force companies to raise prices at its competitors like Walmart. That’s bad for families and another reason we need to #BreakUpBigTech. https://t.co/yblxJ2UA7VLet’s create a federal Office of Broadband Access, and invest $85 billion into making sure every home in America has a broadband connection. That means publicly-owned and operated networks—no giant telecom companies running away with taxpayer dollars. https://t.co/37nVKC8xUeJust like workers need a living wage, farmers need a fair price. It’s time to fix the failed policies that are squeezing our family farmers. https://t.co/69hZoOfj3ICyntoia Brown is finally free—but we can’t forget that she was denied justice for over 14 years. The words above the Supreme Court say \"Equal Justice Under Law.\" We need to start acting like it, and that means standing up for survivors of sexual violence. https://t.co/qDKfSV8ZfPYou heard it at the #AFSCMEForum first—I want a labor leader as my Labor Secretary. https://t.co/mPiTeusMUZI stand in solidarity with the people who protested Donald Trump’s racist rhetoric and inaction on gun violence yesterday. We must fight for #GunReformNow—and I believe we will win. https://t.co/EhfuSAMp6UFarms are being crushed by failed Washington policies and giant agribusinesses, and many rural communities lack access to health care and fast, reliable internet. Our rural communities are being cut off from opportunities to thrive, and I have a plan to fix it. https://t.co/xDdX4P3oM0I want Washington to work for communities all over the country—and make sure every community has the resources it needs to thrive. Together, we can make big improvements in the lives of rural Americans.Agriculture has become one of the biggest polluters in our economy, thanks to decades of failed policy. By paying farmers to fight climate change and investing in R&amp;D we can tackle climate change.I have plans that will help bring affordable housing, child care, and accessible banking to rural communities. My new approach to trade policy will make sure we\\'re keeping good jobs here in America and giving rural communities a voice in trade negotiations.A whole bunch of my other plans will help rural communities, too. My plan to cancel student loan debt and provide free public college will help young people build a future in rural communities, instead of driving them to cities to find a job that can pay down their debt.Here’s my new approach: Guaranteeing farmers a fair price—raising farm incomes and reducing taxpayer expenses. We\\'ll pay farmers for sustainable farming that protects our environment and provide consumers with affordable, local food. https://t.co/B9Qfun34FlFinally, I\\'ve got a plan to overhaul our country\\'s failed approach to the farm economy. For decades, government policy has subsidized industrial agriculture at taxpayers\\' expense while driving environmentally unsustainable farming practices and starving farmers.This ends when I’m president. I\\'ll create a public option for broadband and make sure every home has affordable high-speed internet. I\\'ll crack down on anti-competitive practices and appoint FCC Commissioners who\\'ll restore net neutrality and provide open access to the internet.One of the best tools to expand access to health care—and unlock other economic opportunities—is high-speed internet. But big broadband companies exclude entire communities—especially tribal communities and communities of color—from fast, reliable internet access.I\\'ll also tackle consolidation in health care. If a proposed merger is a first step to closing hospitals or slashing basic services, then a Warren administration will block it. And I\\'ll invest more resources in community health centers and closing today’s rural doctor shortage.My plan starts with protecting access to health care in rural communities, which are rapidly losing access to basic services. That\\'s why I support #MedicareForAll—and why I\\'ll increase Medicare reimbursement rates to help rural hospitals stay afloat.Everyone should have the opportunity to build a good life wherever they live. But as giant corporations and Washington keep cutting off opportunities for huge parts of the country, the shot to succeed gets further out of reach for rural families. I\\'ve got a plan to fix that.I\\'m kicking off my Iowa road trip today! As we head into Iowa, I\\'m sharing my new plans to invest in rural communities. It\\'s time to put their interests ahead of giant companies and Wall Street. https://t.co/P1lbwrcTrRVoting is a fundamental right, and we won\\'t let racist politicians undermine it. On the 54th anniversary of the #VotingRightsAct, I’m re-committing to making it safer and easier for all Americans to vote. It’s part of my plan to strengthen our democracy: https://t.co/v7bNKAnT6Q https://t.co/lx7f7EyYSMI’ve answered over 530 audience questions this year, and the hardest to swallow was from a little boy named Owen in Michigan.

I\\'m in this fight for you and your daughter, Elena. https://t.co/mKpuRLZs3K@senatemajldr And we need a president willing to take executive action herself. I\\'ll do everything I can—and I\\'ll lead the fight for gun legislation from the White House.Donald Trump is enabling white supremacy—and Republicans are enabling him. And when Congress and the American people have tried to fight the gun violence epidemic, @SenateMajLdr has put the NRA first. If we want action, we need to take back the Senate and end the filibuster. https://t.co/aFzwt5lNk7If we want to end gun violence, we need to tackle corruption in Washington head-on. \\n\\nRight now the gun manufacturers—the guys who hire all the lobbyists and make all the campaign contributions—are pulling all the strings.

The Senate has an opportunity to pass them—but Mitch McConnell refuses to act. \\n\\n@SenateMajLdr, you must bring the Senate back into session to vote on this important legislation.White supremacy is not a mental illness. We need to call it what it is: Domestic terrorism. And we need to call out Donald Trump for amplifying these deadly ideologies. https://t.co/1LRZDZFsdpRepublicans won’t act—because gun lobbyists are signing their checks. We must take back the Senate in 2020.\\n\\nWill you chip in to help elect Democrats to the Senate? Let’s build a grassroots movement to beat back the gun lobby and end gun violence. https://t.co/1DWpKHJivAMake no mistake, tomorrow the @NRA will go back to doing the dirty work of gun manufacturers and blocking progress at every turn. @SenateMajLdr must call us back into session to vote on the two background check bills that have already passed the House. https://t.co/uaEmrdMRbYI just talked to @Kasie Hunt about how white nationalism is domestic terrorism. And as Donald Trump has made one ugly statement after another, we’ve seen it on the rise. White nationalists embrace him, and the Republicans enable him.\\n\\nEnough. https://t.co/DumvaThgkZI’ll be there. Grateful to be fighting alongside you to end this epidemic. https://t.co/aBmtJfCnuPWe need to call it out: Fox News is a hate-for-profit machine that gives a megaphone to racists and conspiracists. https://t.co/f1QkIE7sbBWe must treat this like the public health crisis that it is. @SenMajLdr: Bring the Senate back from recess to vote on legislation to address the gun violence epidemic.In March, I was asked about the increase in hate crimes since the election of Donald Trump. I want to be very clear: White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist group—and we need to use the full force of the Justice Department to go after them. https://t.co/EOGUbt2izGWe need to call out white nationalism for what it is—domestic terrorism. It is a threat to the United States, and we\\'ve seen its devastating toll this weekend. And we need to call out the president himself for advancing racism and white supremacy. https://t.co/pdE9CAiQqxWe\\'re waking up to the second mass shooting in as many days. I’m heartsick for the 29 people killed this weekend in El Paso and Dayton—and all the other lives we lose every day due to senseless gun violence.

We need to act—now.@BetoORourke I’m so grateful that everyone on your team is safe and accounted for.

It’s why I’d reject a billionaire-funded super PAC, and why I support overturning Citizens United. We can win with a 100% grassroots movement. https://t.co/XLkcEmVplSLet’s be clear: Layleen Cubilette-Polanco should still be alive. Solitary confinement is cruel and inhumane. We must end this practice, enforce strict standards for medical care, and provide extra layers of protection for LGBTQ+ people.\\nhttps://t.co/J9yjkCd1tFI promise to fight my heart out for workers across the country. https://t.co/jLkhqdJrMcUnder my trade proposal, we will:\\n\\n☑️ Negotiate and approve trade agreements through a transparent process\\n☑️ Use our leverage to raise the global standard of living\\n☑️ Invest in American workers and their families https://t.co/RTxTRpCPs6My team sends great texts! Text FIGHT to 24477 for updates from @TeamWarren (and maybe the occasional photo of Bailey). https://t.co/iHJjGhdzHsThis is what optimism is all about, @VanJones68! https://t.co/QzZiUNgoxoThe way you run a campaign should reflect your values. Ours is 100% grassroots-funded—no federal lobbyists, mega-donor fundraisers, or PAC money of any kind.\\n\\nWill you join our movement and chip in $3 before our July fundraising deadline at midnight? https://t.co/e5MEuPYTwoI read the Mueller report the day it came out, and it was clear to me that it’s a referral for impeachment. Now it’s up to Congress to act. No one is above the law—not even the president of the United States. #DemDebate2America’s trade policies have put giant multinational corporations ahead of American workers, families, farmers, and the environment. I’ve got a plan to change that. I’m proposing a new approach to trade—on our terms. #DemDebate2 https://t.co/M0ILIV637HLast month was the hottest June on record. Flooding and extreme weather have devastated communities and caused billions of dollars in damage this year. Climate change is real and it’s here. We need to take big, bold action now—starting with a #GreenNewDeal. #DemDebate2Immigrants are our neighbors, colleagues, and friends—and every bit as American as those who were born in the U.S. We need a rule-based immigration system that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. I\\'ve got a plan to make that a reality. #DemDebate2 https://t.co/LPDEESENgYPatients are rationing medication, putting their lives and health at risk. Families are begging strangers to help cover medical costs—including necessary care their insurance refuses to cover. This system is failing us. That\\'s why I\\'m fighting for #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateWe need to know how many U.S. citizens have been detained, how long they\\'ve been held, and under what conditions. And we need to know whether agents are using racial profiling when making these wrongful arrests and detentions.U.S. citizens—including 18-year-old Francisco Erwin Galicia and 9-year-old Julia Isabel Amparo Medina—have been detained by @CBP and @ICEgov despite presenting proof of citizenship. I\\'m demanding an investigation into this unacceptable abuse of power. https://t.co/qn2DPNj80REquifax has botched its response to the data breach at every step. We can\\'t count on @Equifax to do the right thing. We need to pass laws that will actually hold them accountable—and I’ve got a bill to do just that. https://t.co/X8Q3ICoODUThe government works great—for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. If we want big, structural change, we need to get big money out of politics and #EndCitizensUnited. I\\'m proud to sign the @USAPromise Candidate Pledge in support of the #28thAmendment. https://t.co/qneTaV0o1A@chelefrei I love it! Thank you for your support.There’s a lot at stake for our democracy. But we can\\'t choose a candidate we don\\'t believe in just because we’re afraid. \\n\\nI’m not afraid.I’m not here to talk about what’s not possible. I’m here to fight for big, structural change. https://t.co/Wz4quR4A4RRunning for president: That’s what girls do! I’m grateful for your support. https://t.co/1DPhzKoDP3Climate change. Student loan debt. Big tech monopolies. You bet I have a plan to help solve these problems—and I believe down to my bones that we can make it happen if we work together. Chip in $3 now if you believe it, too. https://t.co/Qakhyg2s3b@mulatta10 Thankful for your support, Toni!For decades, our government has worked for the rich and the powerful. We’ll change that by being the party of big, structural change. Dollar by dollar, person by person, community by community, we will beat Donald Trump in 2020, and make real change come 2021. #DemDebate https://t.co/lbxX6j9Qkh@JackieCinMHT Thank you, Jackie. We can only do this together!I’m not afraid—and for Democrats to win in 2020, you can’t be afraid either. https://t.co/cmSDTjMDj1I’m so grateful for your support tonight. Whether you joined this grassroots movement a few months or just a few minutes ago—it’s an honor to have you in this fight. Help keep powering this movement, and chip in tonight. #DemDebate https://t.co/owfU0ygd6dWe can’t choose a candidate we don’t believe in just because we’re too scared to do anything else. And we can’t ask other people to vote for a candidate we don’t believe in. https://t.co/C5GYWapmPmI just stepped off the #DemDebate stage feeling grateful and inspired. Person by person, community by community, I believe we can win in 2020. Will you chip in $3 right now to help me return the power to the people?\\nhttps://t.co/nIckfyTW4OThe Democrats are the party of big, structural change. We need to give people a reason to show up and vote. We must build a grassroots movement across this country, person by person, dollar by dollar. I will not only beat Trump—I’ll start making real change come 2021. #DemDebateThe U.S. is not going to use nuclear weapons preemptively, and we need to say so to the entire world. Our first responsibility is to keep ourselves safe. Our military is the best on earth—but we need to use every diplomatic tool we have to prevent nuclear conflict. #DemDebateI’m proposing a two-cent wealth tax on the 75,000 wealthiest families—those worth over $50 million. We’d use that to pay for big, structural changes like #UniversalChildCare, universal free public college, &amp; cancel student loan debt for 95% of Americans with that debt. #DemDebatePeople want access to our markets—so we need to hold other countries to standards. Right now the whole game is working for the big multinational corporations, not American workers. We need to change that. #DemDebateFor decades we’ve had a trade policy written by giant multinational corporations. They have no loyalty or patriotism. If they can make a nickel by moving a plant overseas, they’ll do it. My new trade plan puts small businesses, farmers, and entrepreneurs at the table. #DemDebateMy education plan invests a minimum of $50 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions. That’s one step our country must take to level the playing field for Black and Brown Americans. #DemDebateWe need to call out white supremacy for what it is: Domestic terrorism—and that poses a threat to America. #DemDebateI genuinely do not understand why anyone would go to all the trouble of running for president just to get up on this stage and talk about what’s not possible. #DemDebate https://t.co/cOCz5TS3AFClimate change is an existential crisis in our world. It puts everything living on our planet at risk. My Green Manufacturing plan would invest $2 trillion in green research and exporting, and create 1.2 million new American jobs in green manufacturing. #DemDebateI genuinely do not understand why anyone would go to all the trouble of running for president just to get up on this stage and talk about what’s not possible. #DemDebateI took on the big banks, and I beat them. I took on Wall Street CEOs, and I beat them. I took on a popular incumbent senator, and I beat him. \\n\\nDemocrats win when we go out there and fight for it. I’m not afraid. And for Democrats to win, you can’t be afraid either. #DemDebateRules matter. And it matters if we say our rule is to put people in cages. What we need to do is have a sane immigration system that keeps us safe, but does not criminalize mothers and babies fleeing violence and seeking refuge in America. #DemDebateWe have to be an America that is clear on immigration. We need to expand legal immigration and fix the crisis at the border. What we can’t do is play into Donald Trump’s hands. #DemDebateThe problem is that right now the criminalization statute is what gives Trump the ability to take children away from their parents &amp; lock up people at our borders. We must be a country that lives our values. That means we cannot make it a crime to come to our country. #DemDebateWashington works great for the giant drug companies and insurance companies. Let’s be clear: These insurance companies don’t have a god-given right to suck billions of dollars out of our health care system. We need to have the courage to fight back. #DemDebateThe basic profit model of insurance companies is taking as much money possible in premiums, and pay as little as possible in coverage. Giant corporations and billionaires should pay more taxes, and middle-class families should pay less out of pocket for health care. #DemDebateFamilies are losing their loved ones because they can’t afford life saving medication like insulin. Congress has a duty to act. That’s why I’m fighting to make high-quality, affordable health care accessible to everyone—no exceptions. #DemDebate\\nhttps://t.co/WR9ebDKXJUOne third of donations made through @gofundme go towards helping people pay for health care—including plenty of families who have health insurance and still get hit with crushing medical bills. The system is broken. #DemDebate https://t.co/YuMZ1odBEuInsurance companies sucked $23 billion out of our health care system last year. They profited on the backs of people like @AdyBarkan. Unfortunately, there are so many other stories like his. #DemDebate https://t.co/SVRhJS9hT2My friend @AdyBarkan is a hero not just to me, but to everyone whose health care he’s fought for. When the #GOPTaxScam was poised to cut Medicare—a program that millions of Americans rely on—Ady fought back hard. His story reminds us: We need #MedicareForAll.Health care is a basic human right—and we fight for basic human rights. I\\'ll keep fighting until everyone has access to the health care they need. #MedicareForAll #DemDebateWe’re not going to solve the problems we face with small ideas and spinelessness. We need to be the party of big, structural change. I understand what’s broken, I know how to fix it—and I’m willing to fight to make it happen. #DemDebateLooking forward to taking the stage at the #DemDebate in just a few minutes. Let’s do this! https://t.co/LhpMhUvgyJMy second-grade teacher, Mrs. Lee, changed my whole world (and gave the best hugs). I was happy to learn that Ellie, who won @TeamWarren’s contest to join us for the #DemDebate in Detroit, is a second-grade teacher, too! Let’s hear it for America’s teachers. https://t.co/O8PHtHjwQPOn my way to the #DemDebate! https://t.co/i5L7lLQaUvWow! Thankful for your support, @McGovernMA.

Humbled to fight alongside a trailblazer and friend like @Deb4CongressNM. https://t.co/xeznmMS0hjIt was great talking with @Jaden_Reports after last night’s town hall in Toledo. He had some important questions for me, and I answered. Keep up the great work—you’ve got a bright career ahead of you in the newsroom! https://t.co/i20abBKLrzI’m jazzed up for the #DemDebate tonight! https://t.co/IO6iOLuzvuI got to live my dream of becoming a teacher because an affordable higher education opened a million doors for me.\\n\\nBut chances like the ones I got don\\'t exist anymore. My plan for universal free public college and cancelling student debt would create new opportunities for all. https://t.co/cY9GGiyvAqIn this primary, we have an opportunity to make a real difference in the way campaigns are funded. It’s why I’m fighting my heart out to cut dark money out of politics—and why my campaign is 100% grassroots-funded. https://t.co/0UPemH0B8xThe #GOPTaxScam wasn’t reform—it was a heist. It showered corporations and the wealthy in tax giveaways and kicked everyone else to the curb. I’ve proposed real reform to ensure the wealthiest Americans and corporations pay their fair share.\\nhttps://t.co/4IZmooXhldOne of the best parts of my trip to Detroit in June was reading your hand-written notes about what got you into this fight. Your stories keep me going—and I’m glad to be back in Detroit for the second #DemDebate! https://t.co/RxuXpZJnj6I stand in solidarity with the people of Anchorage, Alaska who are fighting to make their voices heard against extreme budget cuts that could hurt the people of their state. https://t.co/wH7rxCWzg2I’m grateful for the opportunity last night to talk with the people of Toledo about big, structural change—including my new plan to make our trade policy actually work for American families. https://t.co/URFdIGBThAI don’t spend my time chasing big checks from wealthy donors and special interest groups—so I have time to make thank you calls to as many grassroots donors as I can. Chip in $3 now to help build our movement, and I might give you a call to say thanks! https://t.co/EMlFh2VxHTFor decades, America’s trade policy has worked great for the rich and the powerful. American workers? Not so much. Tonight in Toledo, I talked about our need for trade policy that favors the American people, not multinational corporations. https://t.co/Eqcvp839B840,000—and counting! Grateful for each and every one of you. https://t.co/k2vv8JUgXNPowerful corporate interests have poured gigantic sums into capturing our courts. We need judges who value justice for all, not just for the rich and powerful. https://t.co/ELOhzkSN17No student should live in fear of discrimination. As president, I will not only fight my heart out for LGBTQ+ students\\' rights, I will nominate a former public school teacher as education secretary. We need a leader who will actually fight for our kids. https://t.co/eAssxYgC5CNo, it’s not a prank. It’s really me! Thank you, Felipe, for making a contribution to my campaign. We make each other stronger in these fights. https://t.co/a8XzLhyIxPOur government is broken. Wall Street has tilted our laws to favor the rich and the powerful, while working Americans foot the bill.\\n\\nI’m running for president to return the power to the people. Will you chip in $3 now to help me keep up the fight? https://t.co/ASX1L1iYER@NancyLathamLFA @TeamWarren @BayArea4Warren Thank you so much! I can’t wait to read it.@primesuspect Wow! That does look delicious.We need data-based, ecologically sensitive solutions to the threat of fire on our public lands—not giveaways to special interests. https://t.co/StFzV5aOJKWe need to fundamentally transform our approach to trade—and that means using trade to raise wages and combat climate change instead of padding the bottom lines of big multinational corporations who have no allegiance to America. https://t.co/sWLqWabO6dFor decades, our trade policies have been written by corporations to benefit their bottom line. It\\'s time for a new approach. The president has a lot of authority to remake trade policy herself. When I’m elected, I intend to use it. https://t.co/KqNxzzbWWL.@TheRevAl has dedicated his life to the fight for justice for all. No amount of racist tweets from the man in the White House will erase that—and we must not let them divide us. I stand with my friend Al Sharpton in calling out these ongoing attacks on people of color.Trade can be a powerful tool. My plan represents a new approach—one that uses America’s leverage to boost American workers and raise the global standard of living. The president has a lot of authority to remake trade policy herself. When elected, I intend to use it.I’ll end “Investor-State Dispute Settlement”—the favorable enforcement we offer corporations which they\\'ve used to undermine laws that benefit workers &amp; families (like minimum wage increases). And I’ll create a new, stronger approach to enforcing labor &amp; environmental standards.Finally, our approach to enforcing trade deals is driving down standards worldwide. We offer corporations fast and powerful methods to enforce the provisions that benefit them, but make it nearly impossible to enforce labor and environmental protections. It\\'s time to change that.I\\'ll make combating climate change a key focus of our trade deals—and make sure America lives up to the same standards we hold other countries to. I\\'ll require countries we negotiate trade deals with to comply with the Paris Climate accord and end fossil fuel subsidies.I\\'ll also go further to make sure our trade deals ensure consumer safety &amp; protect America\\'s family farms. And I\\'ll fight to bring down the costs of prescription drugs here &amp; around the world by supporting price controls &amp; seeking out opportunities to reduce exclusivity periods.I\\'ll establish a set of standards that countries must meet as a precondition for any trade agreement: covering labor rights, human rights, religious freedom, human trafficking, protecting the environment, currency practices, and combating tax evasion and bribery.For too long, we\\'ve made trade deals with countries with abysmal records on labor, environmental issues, and human rights. They get concrete access to the American market while we get vague commitments to do better—which we hardly enforce. This must end.Our trade negotiations give special access to corporate interests before the agreement is rushed through Congress. I\\'ll end this undemocratic, corrupt practice and negotiate and approve trade deals through a transparent process that offers the public a real chance to shape them.My plan is a whole new approach to trade that will transform every aspect of our current process, from how we negotiate deals, to the negotiating objectives we pursue, to the way we enforce agreements. This isn’t about tough talk—it\\'s about big, structural change.America has enormous leverage in trade negotiations. I won’t hand that leverage to corporations to boost their own profits—I’ll use it to create and defend good American jobs, raise wages, fight climate change, lower drug prices, and raise living standards worldwide.For decades, America’s trade policy has put the profits of big multinational corporations ahead of American workers, farmers, and the environment. I have a new approach: Trade on our terms and only when it benefits American families. Here\\'s my plan. https://t.co/M0ILIV637HYesterday, 4 people were killed and dozens more injured in senseless gun violence attacks in Gilroy and Brooklyn. One of the victims was a 6-year-old child. And these are just the few that made headlines. I’m heartsick. We have a gun violence epidemic. It’s our duty to act—now.I won’t! I promise to fight for your family as hard as I fight for mine. https://t.co/i9jUJceFhRThat’s right.\\n\\nGottlieb’s trip through the revolving door—from head of the @US_FDA to a spot on @Pfizer’s board—is a huge conflict of interest. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, that would be illegal. https://t.co/oIxYzNQ8SWFrom day one, Trump has made his disdain for the intelligence community clear. Our Director of National Intelligence should be above partisan politics, speak truth to power, and resist Trump\\'s abuses of authority. John Ratcliffe doesn\\'t fit that bill.\\nhttps://t.co/VG10AZPGz0@molly_collimore Great meeting you, Molly!Our campaign is 100% grassroots funded. So I spend my time calling as many people as I can to thank them for chipping into this movement. I love making these calls—and I’m planning on making more soon. Donate now and you could be next! https://t.co/vvrYzDjsiBI could feel the energy the moment I stepped through the door.

If you’re ready to get in this fight with me, find an event in your community: https://t.co/VLJuLsqlnS https://t.co/kgXWsxoHwPOur government should keep Americans safe—not allow private prisons to profit off of locking people up. Here’s how my plan to ban private prisons works. https://t.co/XItu5eNPjfWoo-hoo, thanks for coming out today, New Hampshire! I\\'m grateful down to my toes that we got to talk about the big, structural change we\\'re fighting for. https://t.co/pXx0HHffqt@wade_snowden Thank you so much for your letter, Wade. We’ll keep fighting the good fight, together.To get serious about climate change and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, we need to end Big Oil’s stranglehold on Washington. As president, I’ll eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and put a moratorium on new fossil fuel leases offshore or on public lands. https://t.co/ZuNaWhTOTfDonald Trump’s tweets are ugly and racist. They’re purposefully designed to turn us against one another. We cannot let that happen. Instead, we must follow my friend Elijah Cummings’ example and keep doing the work for the American people. https://t.co/t7heu6k3wqTeaching law at @UHouston was a dream come true, but incredibly hard while raising two little kids. Lack of high-quality, affordable child care almost sunk me—until Aunt Bee came to help. The fight for #UniversalChildCare is personal for me. https://t.co/XusjJIfMGYEvery letter I read gives me yet another reason to keep dreaming big and fighting hard for the big, structural change that Americans everywhere want to see. I’m grateful down to my bones for your support. https://t.co/ig15RZscvdI’m running my campaign differently. No federal lobbyists. No fundraisers with mega-donors. No money from PACs of any kind. Instead, I’m spending my time talking with you. Will you chip in $3 right now? It will go a long way—and I might call to say thanks! https://t.co/eJR3TAO0k8Our federal government has underserved HBCUs and MSIs for decades. We need to right these wrongs—starting with my plan to invest at least $50 billion in these important institutions. https://t.co/M8KoYiUCe8Thank you for having me, #PeoplesConvention19! https://t.co/CFpmbHxbl4A person’s HIV status has no bearing on their ability to parent. This is just the latest in a long line of the Trump administration’s cruel attacks on immigrant communities. I want to be clear here: Families belong together—no exceptions. https://t.co/swuC8TiNHOThis is a big win for women who work in politics and for their families. Grateful for @Liuba4Congress’s leadership in making this possible! Next, let’s go a step further and make #UniversalChildCare a reality for everyone. https://t.co/NRd0gPwUtHThe ADA is about civil rights, opportunity, and our values—but there’s more work to be done. As I celebrate the ADA today, I\\'m committing to continue the fight to protect these rights every step of the way. #ADA29That changed with the passage of the ADA—which came about thanks to activists and leaders in Congress like Rep. Major Owens. It not only helped dismantle prejudices about Americans with disabilities, it recognized their right to live, work, and love independently. #ADA29On the 29th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, I’m thinking about my first job out of college—teaching students with speech and learning disabilities at a public school. I saw the difficulties my kids faced navigating a world that wasn’t designed for them. #ADA29The playing field is tilted against entrepreneurs and small business owners of color. A typical Black entrepreneur starts a business with $35,000 in capital—a third of the startup capital for the typical white entrepreneur. Here’s how we change that: https://t.co/LvuawDrL04HBCUs have always had to do more with less. Many are in danger of closing, or have already closed. That\\'s why I have a plan to invest at least $50 billion in HBCUs. https://t.co/Wh0tHVjfwk@WendyENThomas Wow! I love it.For black moms in particular, this maternal mortality crisis is an epidemic. I have a plan to hold health systems accountable for protecting them. https://t.co/WxVm56TGOBWe have the power to prevent these deaths. We need paid leave so that new moms have time to recover—and we need #MedicareForAll so that moms (and their babies!) have access to the health care they need. https://t.co/A0P5zudy5hI’m running a different kind of campaign. Since I don’t spend my time asking rich donors for big checks, I get to spend it with voters instead. That way everyone can get a selfie! https://t.co/dA4S5I6XNwTrump\\'s Department of Justice just approved @TMobile and @Sprint’s $26 billion merger. This merger will cost thousands of jobs, reduce wages, and further reduce competition in a sector that badly needs it. We need antitrust regulators with the courage to stand up to monopolies. https://t.co/IjYoSK1lanExciting news: We just passed one million contributions made to our campaign!\\n\\nWe’re 100% grassroots-funded, &amp; every person who chips in owns a piece of our movement. I couldn’t be more grateful. After Caitlyn made the millionth donation, I called with a double woo-hoo thank you! https://t.co/UvupHb9qW6After Wanda, a math teacher, chipped in to our campaign, I gave her a call to say thanks! Teachers see the worth in every human being—the guy in the White House doesn’t know what he’s up against. https://t.co/PxK9TMu8QKI\\'m thrilled to see that the House has passed #VenezuelaTPS! If Donald Trump really cared about the plight of the Venezuelan people, he wouldn\\'t be deporting those in the U.S. back to violence and fear. Now I hope my Senate colleagues will pass this bill. https://t.co/NimovtwoeERacist voter suppression is real—and we need federal muscle in the fight. Under my plan, there’ll be no more problems with voter registration, no more arbitrary voter purges, and no more gerrymandering. The right to vote is fundamental &amp; we\\'ll protect it. https://t.co/mlwmlQcUTgSandra Pezqueda worked at @TerraneaResort in Southern California.

That’s why I have a plan to secure our elections from foreign threats: https://t.co/WV0BqmElbsToday, it’s a different story. An entire generation is being crippled by student debt and skyrocketing tuition costs. My plan to cancel debt for 95% of Americans with student loan debt, make public college free, and invest in HBCUs would end this crisis. https://t.co/IG9J5C1bMxWhen I was a senior in high school, my family didn’t have the money for college application fees—let alone a college education. Through a mix of scholarships and part-time jobs, I ended up getting my 4-year degree at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester. #TBT https://t.co/y681Na2KesOur criminal justice system has a long history of mistakes when it comes to capital punishment—especially when it comes to Black and Brown people. We cannot let a broken system decide the fate of incarcerated Americans. I oppose the death penalty. https://t.co/ASCKO3k7ET@tracylynngray @NAACP It was great meeting you, Tracy!

If we take bold action now, we can head off another financial crisis before it’s too late. https://t.co/OXt09g6ZjBI read the Mueller report the day it came out. Three things were clear: A hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election, Trump welcomed their help, and Trump obstructed the investigation into that attack. I agree with @NAACP—it\\'s time to begin impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/W0iCN9Cv7kIn just a few minutes, I’ll be speaking live at the 110th #NAACPConvention. I hope you’ll tune in! https://t.co/yiBN2rsFBORobert Mueller’s report is an impeachment referral, and it’s up to Congress to act. But impeachment shouldn’t be the only way that a sitting president can be held accountable for committing a crime. No president is above the law. https://t.co/v1pgkcdRDmI read all 448 pages of the Mueller report, and this much is clear: The president obstructed justice. Attorney General Barr can try to cover it up, but the American people deserve to hear the full truth from Mueller himself. I hope we get that tomorrow. https://t.co/IHqqF4EFIqIt’s about time. Our 9/11 first responders are American heroes—they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and guaranteed the support they need. https://t.co/DbP9KRyXvUThank you for being in this fight, Norelia.

Will you chip in $3 or whatever you can? Every dollar will help keep up our momentum before next week’s fundraising deadline. https://t.co/mYzF8GAny7Our budget reflects our values, and Trump’s new budget proposal makes his perfectly clear. The SNAP program helps working families and students keep food on the table. We should expand it—not cut it. https://t.co/rN8IAAjib1But we should be wary that this administration doesn\\'t abuse this necessary review in order to pursue its own partisan agenda. This issue is too important to be dragged into Trump\\'s petty grievances against these companies. This requires careful congressional oversight.Big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google wield enormous, monopolistic power. I\\'ve been saying that we need to #BreakUpBigTech for a long time and I support a legitimate antitrust investigation into these companies. https://t.co/IS7Vb3CvSJOur economy’s shaky foundation could crumble, but let me be clear: There’s still time to prevent it. That’s why I’m calling on regulators and Congress to act before another crisis gut-punches American families. https://t.co/GBupu40sW1@bergamotperfume Tell you what, we can get a photo next time!

Let’s make our voices heard! https://t.co/mlcyEzJmQXI warned about an economic crash years before the 2008 crisis. But the people with the power to stop it didn’t listen—and families lost it all. When I look at the economy today, I see a lot to worry about again. The good news is that we can head off a crisis—and I\\'ve got a plan. https://t.co/10PSBFJ2VtGeorge, I see you and the thousands of home health care workers who deserve a living wage. No American should work full-time and live in poverty—that’s why I’m in the fight to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. https://t.co/qQaLmX6taD@CabanForQueens It was great chatting with you, Tiffany!My bill with @MarkWarnerVA would have made @Equifax pay double and ensured more relief for people who were hurt. And my Corporate Executive Accountability plan could have held Equifax executives criminally liable. We need more accountability..@Equifax exposed nearly 150 million Americans\\' data, lied about their recklessness, and tried to make money off the scandal. We must go even further to hold Equifax accountable than current law allows—and I have a plan for that. https://t.co/Ld1TVlBB3aI stand with the people of Puerto Rico as they continue to make their voices heard. https://t.co/zUZ4ZbdG4LBetsy DeVos is the worst education secretary we’ve ever had. We need someone who will actually fight for our students, which is why I’ve pledged to nominate a former public school teacher to lead @USEdGov in a Warren administration. https://t.co/M3uzoxTpzUThe warning lights are flashing. Whether it’s this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high. This time, though, we can head it off. Congress and regulators should act immediately.With an economy this vulnerable, we need to reduce the odds of the potential shocks that can send us into another downturn. That means Congress should eliminate the debt ceiling &amp; the Trump administration should replace its trade-war-by-tweet with China with a coherent strategy.We need to strengthen manufacturing by investing in it instead of undercutting it. My Green Manufacturing plan will invest $2 trillion in American green research, manufacturing, and exporting over the next decade, creating more than a million new American jobs.Next, we have to tackle corporate debt. After the 2008 crisis, Congress created the Financial Stability Oversight Council to monitor market risks. But the Trump-era FSOC is falling down on the job. The FSOC should meet to discuss these risks and announce a plan to address them.First, we can reduce household debt by raising wages and bringing down household costs. My plans tackle both sides of this problem, from raising the minimum wage to $15 to canceling student debt and making housing more affordable: https://t.co/QQ7FPYg2PPThe good news is that we have the chance to head off a crisis, just like we had the chance to head it off in 2008, if we take bold action now to address the underlying problems in our economy. Here\\'s what we need to do:Our country’s economic foundation is fragile, and a single shock could bring it all down. Trump\\'s reckless behavior makes that shock more likely. Financial markets and experts agree: We face a serious risk of another recession by the end of 2021—maybe even by the end of 2020.Despite Donald Trump’s promises of a manufacturing “renaissance,” the country is now in a manufacturing recession. For the first time ever, the hourly wage for manufacturing workers has dropped below the national average.Corporations are deeply in debt and taking risky loans, spreading that risk throughout our financial system. These high-risk loans look a lot like pre-2008 sub-prime mortgages: poorly underwritten and with minimal protections, packaged up and sold to investors.I know it sounds stark, but here\\'s what I see today: Families are taking on more debt than ever, thanks to a generation of stagnant wages and rising costs. Student debt has more than doubled since 2008. More than 30% of American adults have debts in collection right now.I warned about an economic crash years before the 2008 crisis, but the people in power wouldn’t listen. Now I’m seeing serious warning signs again—and I’m calling for action before another crisis costs America’s families their homes, jobs, and savings. https://t.co/sU9KGAn6RrI had a terrific time with Mike (our @TeamWarren “Grab a Beer* With Elizabeth” contest winner) and his wife, Linda, from Elma, New York!

I helped President Obama create an agency that would protect consumers—and that’s exactly what happened. The CFPB has forced financial companies to return an estimated $12 billion to the people. https://t.co/vAdlUr9RtRIt’s time to tackle Washington corruption head-on.

That’s why the big banks are building a “political machine” to keep Washington in their vice grip.

Today it won’t keep a mom and her baby out of poverty. I’m glad to see the House pass the #RaiseTheWageAct to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Now the Senate must act.I’m glad to see @AndreaSCousins elected as chair of @TheDLCC board!

Our new bill will help the nearly one in three college students who are food insecure. https://t.co/Zx9zLPOTgbRead this thread. These tactics make a handful of Wall Street managers very rich, but are costing thousands of people their jobs, putting valuable companies out of business, and hurting communities across the country. https://t.co/VKgm8KXPim#IStandWithIlhan against attacks from this racist president, and we should all remember this definition of patriotism. https://t.co/PzFT1bNfF2Letting financial firms run wild is undermining our economy. I am done with Washington ignoring the evidence and acting as if boosting Wall Street helps families. It\\'s time to stop the looting, boost wages, grow our economy, and rein in Wall Street.I’ve spent a lot of my career studying how financial firms make money by tricking and trapping families. And after I proposed a new federal agency to protect consumers, I spent nearly a year setting up the @CFPB and helping write new rules to crack down on financial scams.Finally, Wall Street sucks money away from companies that need it to grow. My Accountable Capitalism Act would end big companies catering to the short-term interests of Wall Street and let our companies focus on long-term growth and their obligations to workers.Too many families face a choice of paying a late fee on their bills, an overdraft fee to the bank, or a sky-high interest rate to a payday lender while waiting on checks. The government should adopt real-time payment technology so families don\\'t have to wait for checks to clear.I’ve spent years advocating for postal banking—allowing the United States Postal Service to partner with local community banks and credit unions to provide access to low-cost, basic banking services. As President, I’ll make it happen by appointing people committed to the cause.It\\'s also time to push our financial system back to its core purpose—giving people a place to put their money &amp; connecting savers with borrowers. Our system doesn’t serve a huge slice of the country: 25% of American households don’t have adequate access to a simple bank account.And we need to end the system where bankers can make huge bonuses if risky bets pay off but lose nothing if they fail. I\\'ll appoint regulators who will impose tough new rules to rein in banker pay.First, we should enact my 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, which rebuilds the wall between commercial and investment banks and ends taxpayer subsidies for excessive risk-taking and speculation.Next, my plan would address the incentives that fuel useless speculation that can make bankers rich but undermines the rest of the economy. Washington has encouraged this speculation with giveaways, subsidies, and lax rules. I want to end these practices immediately.My plan starts by ending this looting and fundamentally changing the industry. Private equity firms will only make money if the company succeeds. And if they make bad investments, they\\'ll be held accountable instead of walking away with millions.Just look at the private equity industry. They buy companies and bleed them dry. And when the company fails, the Wall Street guys walk away with millions while workers are left holding the bag. It\\'s legalized looting.Study after study shows that, past a certain point, a growing financial sector hurts the rest of the economy by extracting money from it. And America is way past that point.For decades, Washington has lived by a simple rule: If it’s good for Wall Street, it’s good for the economy. But it just isn’t true. Big banks are making record profits and handing out huge bonuses as average wages barely budge.Wall Street is looting the economy—and Washington is helping them do it. I’m tired of big financial firms padding their own pockets while the rest of the economy suffers, and that’s why I’ve got a plan to end it: https://t.co/klbgd2nFgVWe must call out those who remain silent. We must initiate impeachment proceedings to hold him accountable. And we must build an unstoppable grassroots movement that resoundingly defeats not just Trump, but complicit Republicans everywhere.This president is desperate. Calling out his racism, xenophobia, and misogyny is imperative. But he’s trying to divide us and distract from his own crimes, and from his deeply unpopular agenda of letting the wealthy and well-connected rip off the country. We must do more.On #HIVPreventionDay, let’s recommit to HIV research and treatment, and work to ensure that everyone has access to PrEP, HIV testing, and other vital health care services. https://t.co/IfVpCwfaVIOur fight for a federal minimum wage will not come at the cost of employment for Americans with disabilities.

I said, “We can get some if you want!” He smiled, picked up a carton, and told me he was thinking about his family. “We didn’t eat things like fresh strawberries,” he explained.Grateful down to my toes to have you in this fight alongside me, @Liuba4Congress! https://t.co/mVdgZIJW3GI stand in solidarity with @Lights4Liberty activists around the world shining a light on the inhumane practices at our border. We must ban for-profit detention centers and treat immigrants with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/JlpYwpIVGnI’m deeply saddened to hear that Héctor Figueroa—a tireless fighter for workers and unions—has passed. Héctor’s leadership as president of @32BJSEIU deeply inspired me, and I’m honored to have known him. https://t.co/IkWyRWsFrqI’m praying for New Orleans and its resilient people as they brace for major flooding from Tropical Storm #Barry. Climate change is an existential threat—and we must take action now.Then we must go a step further: Universal free public college and the cancellation of student debt for 95% of Americans who carry it. My plan would fix the student loan debt crisis—and prevent another one from happening again. https://t.co/IG9J5CiNb7But under @BetsyDeVosED\\'s watch, fewer than 1% of borrowers who applied to the program have had their loans forgiven.\\n\\nI stand with @AFTunion in fighting back and making things right for these borrowers. https://t.co/oPCDDxjkidWhen thousands of public servants were at risk of being denied federal student loan relief, I pushed back.

Looking forward to chatting with you soon!Grateful to be a part of the 110th annual @NAACP convention! https://t.co/Z8cjm5r10qMy immigration reforms tackle Donald Trump’s cruel policies and our broken immigration system head-on. We need a rules-based system that is fair, humane, and reflects our values. https://t.co/AbInfiY4mvThe Trump administration’s cruelty runs bone-deep. A Warren administration will not rip families apart to try and score political points. https://t.co/3JZzZmjDFbImmigrants are woven into the fabric of our country—and they are #HereToStay. https://t.co/NcSDugduRmPresident Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. It’s time to end this cruelty. Here’s my plan to do just that: https://t.co/LPDEESENgY https://t.co/Md5eMKPtqvWe need big, structural change in our immigration system. Today, I announced my plan for fair, humane immigration reform that reflects our values. Read the plan and join our fight: https://t.co/LPDEESENgY https://t.co/Ov6lLCAG1UThis ruling on #TitleX is part of a targeted attack on women with low incomes and women of color by right-wing ideologues. We must pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care. I have a plan for that: https://t.co/5iQd3AEeOD https://t.co/iIo2p98jjeNecesitamos un cambio estructural: un sistema de inmigración justo que preserve nuestra seguridad, ayude a crecer nuestra economía y refleje nuestros valores.Trabajaré con el Congreso para aprobar una reforma de inmigración de gran alcance, pero también estoy lista para ejercer el poder ejecutivo si se niegan a actuar.No podemos enfrentar la migración hasta que no enfrentemos sus causas—pobreza, cambio climático, violencia e injusticia. Como presidenta, restauraré e incrementaré esfuerzos para enfrentar el crimen transnacional. Y mi administración protegerá a las personas que busquen asilo.Trabajaré para expandir la inmigración legal e implementaré acciones ejecutivas para proteger a los Dreamers y aquellos que han formado sus vidas en nuestro país, mientras trabajamos para crear una solución legislativa que asegure una ruta justa y asequible a la naturalización.Nuestras leyes y valores nos impulsan a ayudar a los que huyen de la violencia y la opresión. Como presidenta, rechazaré las políticas de exclusión basadas en raza, religión o nacionalidad. En mi primer día, revertiré la política racista de la prohibición de los musulmanes.Eliminaremos la expulsión rápida y proveeremos el debido proceso bajo la ley para inmigrantes enfrentando deportación, garantizando que tengan vistas en la corte y dándoles acceso a consultoría legal.Acabaré con la detención innecesaria, enfocando estos esfuerzos en personas que presenten un riesgo de fuga o riesgos a la seguridad de otros. Y, para prevenir abusos futuros en nuestro sistema de inmigración, mi administración establecerá cortes independientes de inmigración.Reduciré la detención de manera drástica. Separar a las familias y detener a los vulnerables es costoso, inhumano, y se ha comprobado que no tiene un efecto disuasivo.Mi administración exigirá la rendición de cuentas por los abusos cometidos bajo la administración de Trump. Designaré un grupo de trabajo en el DOJ para investigar acusaciones graves y les daré autoridad independiente para que puedan presentar denuncias penales.Las agencias de inmigración deberían proteger a los estadounidenses y defender nuestras leyes, en vez de dedicarse a perseguir políticas punitivas y anti inmigratorias que afectan—mayormente—a las comunidades de color. Como presidenta, reconstruiré el CBP y ICE de pies a cabeza.Entrar al país sin autorización siempre ha sido una violación civil bajo la ley de inmigración, pero gracias a un ex senador segregacionista, también es una violación criminal. Esto es innecesario para la seguridad fronteriza y deberíamos eliminar esta prohibición criminal.Mi plan comienza por eliminar el cumplimiento de la ley de manera abusiva. Trump ha usado la deportación como un arma costosa, ineficaz y diseñada para maximizar el dolor. Como presidenta de los Estados Unidos, acabaré con esta crueldad.Los inmigrantes son nuestros vecinos, colegas y amigos. Son tan parte de EE.UU. como aquellas personas que han nacido en este país. Nuestro sistema de inmigración debería ser justo, humano y debería reflejar nuestros valores. Nuestros vecinos no deberían vivir con miedo.Trump ha llevado nuestro sistema de inmigración al extremo más punitivo. Sus políticas racistas se basan en un sistema roto y una infraestructura del cumplimiento de la ley que es abusiva. Hoy anuncio mi plan para reformar nuestro sistema de inmigración. https://t.co/xLFiLvI8mHI’ll work with Congress to pass broad-reaching reform, but I’m also prepared to move forward with executive action if they refuse to act. We need big, structural change: A fair immigration system that preserves our security, grows our economy, and reflects our values.But we cannot fully address migration until we address its root causes—poverty, climate change, violence and injustice. As president, I’ll restore and increase aid and step up efforts to address transnational crime. And my administration will protect those seeking refuge here.I’ll also work to expand legal immigration and take executive action to provide a measure of protection for our Dreamers and those who have built careers and families here, while pursuing a legislative solution that provides a fair and achievable path to citizenship.Our laws and our values compel us to help those fleeing violence and oppression. As president, I’ll reject exclusionary policies based on race, religion and nationality, and I’ll reverse Trump’s bigoted Muslim Ban on my first day in office.To prevent future abuses of our immigration system, my administration will establish independent immigration courts. We\\'ll eliminate expedited removal and provide due process for immigrants facing deportation, guaranteeing hearings and providing access to counsel.Next, I’ll significantly reduce immigration detention. Separating families and detaining the vulnerable is expensive, inhumane, and has no proven deterrent effect. I’ll end unnecessary detention, detaining only those who pose a safety risk, and stop for-profit detention entirely.And my administration will demand accountability for the abuse committed under the Trump administration. I\\'ll set up a DOJ task force to investigate accusations of serious violations and give it independent authority to pursue any criminal allegations.Our immigration agencies should protect Americans and uphold the rule of law, not pursue punitive anti-immigrant policies that target communities of color. As president, I\\'ll reshape CBP and ICE from top to bottom.Entering the country without authorization has always been a violation of civil immigration law, but thanks to a former segregationist senator, it’s also a criminal violation. This is totally unnecessary for border security, and we should repeal the criminal prohibition.My plan starts with eliminating abusive enforcement. Trump has weaponized deportation in ways that are costly, ineffective, and designed to maximize pain. As president, I will end this cruelty.Immigrants are our neighbors, our colleagues, and our friends—and every bit as much a part of America as those who were born in the United States. Our immigration system must be fair, humane, and reflect our values. Our neighbors shouldn’t have to live in fear.President Trump has taken our immigration system to its most punitive extreme, but his racist policies build on a broken system and an enforcement infrastructure already primed for abuse. Today, I\\'m announcing my plan to reform our immigration system. https://t.co/LPDEESENgYLike a lot of Americans, my life has had a lot of twists and turns. Here’s my story—from falling in love and dropping out of college, to chasing my dream of being a public school teacher. https://t.co/tVDrhS4SDiFrom the overflow to the front row, I’m so inspired by the energy in New Hampshire. Thankful for everyone who came out to our Peterborough town hall this week! https://t.co/aGxfI36YPsLet\\'s call this what it really is: Exploitation for profit. We must put an end to for-profit immigration detention centers and private prisons, and I\\'ve got a plan to do just that: https://t.co/CUduueEhP5 https://t.co/SfTzYlnIPtThese stories are horrifying. Children are in danger. We need answers.\\nhttps://t.co/5FQDbbo2Wa@AnitaYandle I believe in you. Persist!For a lot of candidates, “call time” means phoning millionaires and asking for big checks.\\n\\nNot me. \\n\\nI spend my “call time” thanking supporters and talking with voters. Our campaign is a 100% grassroots-funded movement, fueled by the people. https://t.co/ab6thtkbZ1We need to take bold action to attack climate change. I\\'m proud to support the #GreenNewDeal. I\\'ve also got plans to invest in clean energy tech and to stop drilling and promote renewables on public lands. This plan is another tool we can use to attack climate change.My Climate Risk Disclosure plan requires companies to publicly disclose both environmental &amp; financial climate-related risks to their business. Investors are already divesting from fossil fuel companies, and this will push more investors to divest and transition to clean energy.Publicly traded companies have an obligation to share important information about their business. But right now they don\\'t share much about how climate change might affect them, their customers, and their investors.I\\'ve got a new plan to accelerate the transition to clean energy and combat climate change. I\\'m proud it has the support of former Vice President @algore, and @EdMarkey and @AOC—the original authors of the Green New Deal. https://t.co/zdOBbDJzlRMy mother’s minimum wage job at Sears saved our family after my daddy’s heart attack. In today’s America, it won’t keep a mama and baby out of poverty. We must raise the minimum wage to $15. Working families deserve living wages. #FightFor15@paulapoundstone We’ll persist together!Today, Republican lawmakers in VA ignored their responsibility to protect the people of their state from another mass shooting like the one in Virginia Beach. I stand behind leaders like @SheilaForVA who know what it takes to end this crisis. https://t.co/m6Xx2lGPjXIn this primary, we have a chance to build a 100% grassroots movement.

This is how we’re going to win—together. https://t.co/JslG4V6a1NThe Democratic primary should not be decided by billionaires, whether they’re funding Super PACs or funding themselves.

My housing plan tackles the legacy of racist redlining head-on. https://t.co/5UPvYuKyZrI opposed Secretary Acosta\\'s nomination, and voted against his confirmation.

Go Cougars!The experiences of women of color are not one-dimensional: Sexual orientation, gender identity, and ability all shape how a person’s work is valued in the workplace.

Thank you, @NEAToday and @Lily_NEA! https://t.co/hVvvX5Zu7yAmerica’s public school teachers are real heroes—I’m glad we got to talk today backstage at @NEAToday’s presidential forum. Tune in to watch my remarks live at the conference in just a few minutes. https://t.co/v5hVPP7ctq https://t.co/IYX7vQf4f8Our government saddled a generation with $1.5 trillion in student loan debt. That’s why I’m calling for universal free college and cancelling student loan debt for more than 95% of Americans who have it. We must end the student debt crisis. https://t.co/IG9J5CiNb7Betsy DeVos is the worst Secretary of Education in our history. We need someone who will actually fight for students, not for giant corporations. So when @Liat_RO suggested that the next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher, I pledged to make it happen. https://t.co/s5Un8ZXgreLooking forward to @NEAToday’s presidential forum today and the opportunity to talk about my plan to appoint a public school teacher as the next education secretary. Tune in! https://t.co/oqTgnXQM9dBlack women are more likely to be breadwinners for their families, yet they are paid less and are less likely to be able to afford health care, child care, and housing. I\\'m proud to share my new plan to address this head on at #EssenceFest this weekend: https://t.co/COUKtCr5NFThis is just the first step—but it’s a necessary one. It’s time to build an America that recognizes the role that women of color play in their families and in the economy, that fairly values their work, and that delivers equal opportunity for everyone.Finally, I will strengthen enforcement against systemic discrimination. I will direct federal agencies to target enforcement towards industries where we know women of color face higher rates of discrimination.I will also make sure the senior ranks of the federal government look like America. My administration will ensure that federal agencies recruit women of color and develop leadership paths for them. The government should do better if it demands more from the private sector.First, I will have new requirements for federal contractors: companies with bad track records on equal pay and management diversity won’t get new contracts. No contractor will be permitted to use forced arbitration and non-compete clauses for low- and medium-wage workers.The government has helped perpetuate the systemic discrimination that has denied women of color equal opportunities, and it’s time to right those wrongs. I\\'ve got a plan to boost their wages, open up career advancement, and fight systemic discrimination.The gender pay gap hits women of color particularly hard. When future employers use salary history to make new offers, they trap women of color in lower wages. Black and Brown women are disproportionately mistreated at work. Their path to higher-level management jobs is rockier.Women of color face a steeper climb to provide financial security for their families because of systemic discrimination. On Day One of a Warren administration, I’ll take a series of executive actions to help boost their wages and leadership opportunities. https://t.co/qpzW3XDjT4On #IndependenceDay, I’m celebrating our democracy—and recommitting to protect it. Our elections should be as secure as Fort Knox. Instead, they’re less secure than an Amazon account. I have a plan to make voting easy and secure for everyone. https://t.co/aVlfkDnVhaThank you, Nevada!

Thanks for having me! https://t.co/EgFwGyMKgCToday we celebrate our country and recommit to the big, structural changes we need to make our government and our economy work for everyone—not just for those at the top. I’ll fight my heart out for that. Happy #IndependenceDay! https://t.co/H67COylonYBig Tech companies like Facebook hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers to help shape the rules in their favor and throw around their economic power to snuff out every potential competitor.

I’m shocked! https://t.co/XJf0kQIJC0It should be illegal for former U.S. Senator @DavidVitter to go from serving the American people one day to lobbying for Russian oligarchs the next. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, it would be. https://t.co/n8Cii95ScfTalk about a conflict of interest: Former @US_FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb just joined the board of @Pfizer—a Big Pharma corporation he once regulated. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, that would be illegal.\\nhttps://t.co/g0j1xYmzqaNo, Jamie. Corporate greed and corruption in Washington are what’s really wrong with America.

I hope I’ll see you there! https://t.co/f5voiyzbJNThis kind of xenophobic fear-mongering is sick. In a Warren administration, immigrant communities will be able to live without fear or discrimination. I will fight for them every step of the way. https://t.co/kTHmr8CRBjWhen I’m president, I’ll make certain that every person—regardless of race, creed, or economic background—is paid a living wage so they can build a secure future for themselves and their families. That’s how we’ll make our economy work for working people.I’ve got a new plan to protect our democracy! We must:\\n\\n🗳️ Make voting easy and convenient\\n🗳️ Stop racist voter suppression\\n🗳️ Secure our elections https://t.co/dTZD30hh0MArbitration lets giant banks like @JPMorgan get away with scamming customers out of money.

If you agree it’s time for a woman president to make big, structural change, chip in $3 or whatever you can before our big June FEC deadline. https://t.co/bvsVQzsaoBOur country faces a housing crisis that disproportionately affects Black and Brown Americans. @HUDGov must address this—not just in the policies it pursues, but in the people it hires. Blankenstein\\'s racist writings disqualify him from working there. https://t.co/4DbB8Lt78mOur kids shouldn’t have to go to school every day fearing for their lives. I’m fighting for common-sense gun reform, including banning assault weapons, preventing domestic abusers from legally obtaining guns, and ending the gun show loophole. https://t.co/3NiuvW3FwhWe need to fight for immigrant families and stop Donald Trump’s racist policies—and we can only do it together. https://t.co/88tuOS7iqp@Mythagon Dream big, fight hard, and climb high, Ashli!Disgusting. My democracy plan would re-enfranchise those who have served their time and left prison—and prevent states like Florida from overriding their rights with Jim Crow-era nonsense. https://t.co/w3plxCZeyFOur campaign is 100% powered by the people: Grassroots supporters who chip in whatever they can to dream big, fight hard, and win in 2020. Will you chip in $3 and join the fight? I might call you to say thanks! https://t.co/eKcs5Pn8xFFifty years ago at #Stonewall, LGBTQ+ rights activists knew it wouldn’t be easy. But they also knew what was at stake. They kept going and they changed the course of history. Today, we recommit to fighting for LGBTQ+ equality. #Stonewall50 https://t.co/olOM8a4jN7I’m glad to see Kansas take this necessary step and recognize trans Americans for who they are. The rest of the country should do the same. https://t.co/ebzWot7A4rAs the Supreme Court prepares to take on the #DACA case, I want to make something clear: Immigrant youth are #HereToStay and I will fight my heart out to protect Dreamers. https://t.co/zpa73gHnulI don’t spend my time at fancy closed-door fundraisers trading favors for money, and I’ll appoint only the most qualified person for the job. In a Warren administration, I pledge not to give ambassadorial posts to wealthy donors or bundlers. Period.Trump has perfected the act of selling swanky diplomatic posts to rich buffoons. He\\'s appointed political cronies to nearly half the available ambassadorial positions. He may think a fat wallet and a big campaign check qualifies someone to represent our country abroad. I don\\'t.To do this, we need to recruit a new generation of foreign service officers and retain talented officers. I’ll also significantly expand the pool of diplomatic talent. Today’s foreign service is 79% white and 65% male. Our foreign service must reflect the diversity of the U.S.Our foreign policy should not be run out of the Pentagon. Under a Warren administration, it won’t be. So I’ll start by doubling the size of the foreign service and opening new diplomatic posts in underserved areas to broaden U.S. diplomatic presence.The Pentagon is nearly 40 times bigger than the State Department—we employ more people in military grocery stores than we do foreign service officers. Our underinvestment in diplomacy causes our leaders to default to military action, instead of treating it as a last resort.Senior career officials at the State Department have been pushed out &amp; others have resigned in protest. We\\'ve lost 60% of our career ambassadors &amp; 20% of our most experienced civil servants. Too often they\\'ve been replaced with totally unqualified campaign donors &amp; Trump cronies.To take a meaningful leadership position in the world, protect our interests, and avoid conflicts, we need world-class diplomats. But through a toxic combination of malice and neglect, Donald Trump has declared war on the State Department.The practice of auctioning off American diplomacy to the highest bidder must end. I\\'m pledging to end the corrupt practice of selling cushy diplomatic posts to wealthy donors—and I call on everyone running for President to do the same. Read my full plan: https://t.co/Bd6E6g8bYX@LeahTheActivist I won’t forget it either, Leah. We’re in this fight together.It’s true! Atticus is a terrific dancer.\\nhttps://t.co/s4vPCMDkx8I do! I love my team. https://t.co/ig8cqKRJ7mToday, Trump joked with Putin about interfering in our elections. He joked about getting \"rid of\" journalists with a man who has reporters murdered. The president is looking out for himself—not the American people. We need a president who will always stand up for American values.We can make the #GreenNewDeal a reality and lead the global effort to combat climate change. My Green Manufacturing Plan would invest $2 trillion in green research and manufacturing and create more than a million good jobs here at home. #DemDebate2 \\u200ahttps://t.co/d4Nke32oE1#RoeVWade established a woman’s constitutional right to safe, legal abortion and has been law for over 46 years. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive care no matter what the Supreme Court does. #DemDebate2 https://t.co/iBzvjDBCL4Immigration is our strength. But an immigration system that can’t tell the difference between a 7-year-old and a criminal or a terrorist is deeply broken. It’s time for real reform to make our immigration policies consistent with our values. #DemDebate2I\\'m tired of insurance company executives getting rich while denying care to you and your family. You should get the care you need, where you need it, from your doctor. Health care is a basic human right. That\\'s why I\\'m fighting for #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateMy #UltraMillionaireTax is a two-cent tax on the 75,000 biggest fortunes in the country—those worth over $50 million. We’d use it to pay for #UniversalChildCare, student loan debt cancellation, free public college, and more. Here’s how it works. #DemDebate https://t.co/QExyERvBskThis is my promise to you. https://t.co/d4yTvoiy1pAmerica supports #RoeVWade. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect and ensure real access to birth control and abortion care—laws that will stand no matter what the Supreme Court does. And I\\'ve got a plan for that. https://t.co/iBzvjDBCL4 #DemDebate https://t.co/vrUeLmAy2gI know @TeamWarren is working hard to win in 2020. Something else we need to work hard on: Protecting our democracy. At our Miami town hall, I made a commitment to protect our elections. https://t.co/6RheK3sRt5Here’s what’s covered under my new plan to protect U.S. elections: \\n\\n🗳️ No more voter registration problems\\n🗳️ No more voter purges\\n🗳️ No more gerrymandering \\n🗳️ Election Day will be a federal holiday\\nhttps://t.co/HRFuZrTjRVThe harsh truth is that our elections are vulnerable to attack. Some voter registration databases are still using Windows 2000. My latest plan would make U.S. elections as secure as Fort Knox. https://t.co/iujRObDDyjYesterday, I met activists who’ve been standing outside Homestead for months. I met grandmas and moms, dads and uncles. I met little children and a woman who said, “I’ll be here every day.” Together, we’re fighting for immigration policies that reflect our values. https://t.co/RTImkW95iFThe Census must count every person. Our Constitution demands it. Our democracy requires it. And I hope that the courts will continue to keep this racist and blatantly partisan question off of the 2020 Census..@NALEO\\'s ¡Hágase Contar! Census 2020 Campaign is already working to ensure that immigrant and Latinx communities are fully counted, and I join them in calling on these communities to be heard.Finally, we\\'d ban the use of citizenship questions in government surveys and implement lasting reforms to the Census to prevent any president from using these kinds of tricks to take political representation or other resources away from immigrant communities.Next, my administration would conduct a second Census—without any questions about citizenship—to replace Trump\\'s tainted Census in advance of the 2022 midterm elections. And I would have an aggressive, well-funded outreach campaign to reach historically undercounted communities.Here\\'s how this would work. First, I would immediately direct all executive agencies to ignore the tainted Census data until a new Census is complete. States receive nearly $600 billion per year from 16 programs tied to Census data, &amp; we won\\'t allow a tainted Census to skew that.If the Trump admin somehow manages to get that question back on the Census, I will cancel that rigged Census and replace it with a fair and accurate one. And I\\'ll make this promise right now: A Warren administration would never include a citizenship question on the Census.The Supreme Court\\'s ruling blocking the citizenship question on the 2020 Census is a welcome relief—but the Court has left open the possibility that the Trump administration could still add a citizenship question to the Census. And if they do, I have a plan for that.I\\'m done playing by a different set of rules. As president, I\\'ll push to require states to use independent redistricting commissions to draw fair districts. And if Republicans keep standing in the way of fair elections, I\\'ll push to end the filibuster. https://t.co/WV0BqmmKjUMitch McConnell says efforts to stop gerrymandering are \"socialist\". Chief Justice Roberts pays lip service to the idea that gerrymandering is bad—but then hands the keys to our democracy over to a bunch of cheats. Republicans are trying to rig the game, and they\\'re winning.The Supreme Court\\'s decision is an abomination. Five Republican-appointed justices gave the green light to partisan gerrymandering—which lets Republicans pursue their extreme agenda without accountability to the people. It\\'s bad for our democracy and we need to fight back.You bet I have a plan to deal with Mitch McConnell. We need leadership from within our government—but we also need a grassroots movement to push from the outside and make Congress reflect the will of the people. And we have to get rid of the filibuster. #DemDebate https://t.co/X0ODfTwoRyThe economy is doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It’s time to build an economy that works for all of us. And I’ve got plans for that. #DemDebate https://t.co/8oBa9a4TmBI spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke, and one of the top reasons is a medical emergency. That\\'s not right. Our system is working for corporations making a profit, but not for families. That\\'s why I\\'m fighting for #MedicareForAll. #DemDebate https://t.co/MhYfR235nGI just stepped off the #DemDebate stage. I have a lot of plans for big, structural change, but we can only do this together. Chip in $3 or more before our big FEC deadline and help power our grassroots campaign. https://t.co/pSUwFnT5qqI’m in this fight for a government and an economy that works for the people, not the rich and the powerful. I promise you this: I will fight for you as hard as I fight for my family. #DemDebateNo one should be above the law—that includes the president of the United States. I’ve got a plan to ensure that a sitting president can be held accountable for committing a crime. #DemDebate https://t.co/v1pgkcdRDmThe threat posed by climate change is real, it’s man-made, and we are running out of time. We need to take big, bold actions now—starting with the #GreenNewDeal. #DemDebateWe’re fighting for big, structural change to our economy, our government, and our democracy. And if Senate Republicans continue the same playbook of blocking legislation like they did with President Obama, I’ll get rid of the filibuster. #DemDebateI have a LOT of plans—and you bet I have one to deal with Mitch McConnell. In the 2020 elections, we have to push from outside, have leadership on the inside, &amp; make congress reflect the will of the people. The fight still goes on to make Congress work for the people. #DemDebateSince running for president, I’ve answered thousands of questions. Earlier this month, a kid asked me, “What are you doing to keep children safe?” We need to fight this with every tool in the toolbox—that means treating it like the public health emergency that it is. #DemDebateAs president, I would make sure our country gets back on the 2015 Iran Deal. We can\\'t afford another forever war, and I’m fighting to stop Donald Trump from dragging us into another one. #DemDebateI went to the Homestead, FL detention center today. It’s hot and barren, with a completely enclosed fence. I saw children being marched from one building to another in single file lines. No laughing, no playing. These are children who are prisoners. #DemDebateEvery woman should have access to the full range of reproductive services, including safe, legal abortion. Most people in this country support #RoeVWade, and we need to make it the law. Here’s my plan to protect reproductive health. #DemDebate https://t.co/iBzvjDBCL4Women’s rights are human rights. We need to:\\n\\n✔ Protect #RoeVWade.\\n✔ End the #HydeAmendment.\\n✔ Defend #TitleX family planning funding.\\n✔ Ensure that #MedicareForAll includes contraception and abortion coverage.\\n\\nhttps://t.co/iBzvjDBCL4\\n\\n#DemDebateYes, I would support government-run insurance. Health care is a basic human right, and we fight for basic human rights. We need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateI’ve spent my life studying why families go broke, and one of the biggest reasons is the cost of health care. Well, I\\'m tired of insurance companies getting rich while families get stretched to a breaking point. We need #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateSome politicians say Medicare for All isn’t possible. What they’re really saying is that they don’t want to fight. Well, I do. Health care is a basic human right. We fight for basic human rights, and that’s why I’m fighting for #MedicareForAll. #DemDebateAs president, I will pursue an agenda of economic patriotism, using new and existing tools to defend and create quality American jobs and promote American industry. It\\'s time to put American workers ahead of Wall Street bonuses and multinational profits. https://t.co/pWxwPq2uV1There’s way too much consolidation in our economy. It hurts our workers, our entrepreneurs, our consumers, and our economy. I want to return the government to the people, and calling out the names of monopolies is saying that I have the courage to go after them. #DemDebateRight now our economy is doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. It’s not doing great for the rest of Americans. It’s corruption plain and simple—and we need to address it head on and make big, structural change to fight it. #DemDebateI’m on my way to the first #DemDebate with Bruce and the team! I’m looking forward to talking about why I’m in this race and my plans for big, structural change. https://t.co/Yq8ND9lgUKPerson to person, one dollar at a time, we’re building a grassroots movement.

No laughing, no playing. These are children who are prisoners. https://t.co/7WB4G8sI5nAt Homestead, a young girl named Lea gave me a hand-written note. She wrote about the fear of losing her parents to deportation and asked me to fight for immigration reform.\\n\\nNo child should have to grow up with that fear. Lea, I promise: We’re in this fight together. https://t.co/sKbYJ9uQEkI went to the Homestead, FL detention center this morning to shine a light on what’s happening. There’s no place in this country for operating private prisons that profit off of cruelty. Detention centers like the one in Homestead should be shut down. https://t.co/ttv7ziHATsThese are children—children. \\n\\nMark Morgan’s racist comments disqualify him from leading @ICEGov. https://t.co/pxajk1nmLI.@ICEGov needs to answer for its misuse of solitary confinement. Immigrants in custody who are disabled or are sexual assault survivors may be especially in need of protection. Locking them up for at least 22 hours a day is cruel and unnecessary. https://t.co/KDFKBU1XuE“They had been detained for weeks without access to soap, clean clothes or adequate food.”\\n\\nThis is inhumane. In a Warren administration, we will treat immigrant children with the dignity and respect they deserve. https://t.co/WdkLClM4KJThere are a lot of different ways that we get in the fight. And one of them is that you show up. I\\'m at the Homestead detention center today and I hope you\\'ll be watching. https://t.co/vzXqUlaiIMA year ago today, SCOTUS made the wrong decision in upholding Donald Trump’s bigoted and xenophobic Muslim ban. We won’t forget and we won’t stop fighting until Muslims are treated with dignity and respect.Yesterday at my town hall in Miami, I got asked an important question: Would I go to the Homestead detention center to shine a light on what\\'s happening? The answer is yes. I\\'ll be there today and I hope you\\'ll join me. https://t.co/gIAwNywrn7The Mueller report made clear that the president obstructed justice multiple times. If he were anyone else, he\\'d be in handcuffs. Attorney General Barr can try to cover for the president all he wants, but the American people deserve to hear the full truth from Mueller himself.At tonight\\'s town hall in Miami, an audience member asked me to go to the Homestead detention center—where the Trump administration is holding immigrant children separated from their families—and shine a light on what\\'s happening. I\\'ll be there tomorrow—and I hope you\\'ll join me. https://t.co/tf2aaOakbFOne way I’m fighting is through my plan to end for-profit detention centers, which have made millions implementing Trump’s cruel immigration policies. Today 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities. Under my plan, we’ll end this. https://t.co/CUduueEhP5I saw the same thing at a @CBP processing center in McAllen, TX. I\\'ll never forget listening to traumatized moms and children begging to be reunited. Let me make this clear: I\\'ll never stop fighting Trump\\'s cruel immigration policies. \\nhttps://t.co/ZO8bQMZFpoThis week marks a year since I visited the Port Isabel Reunification Center in Los Fresnos, TX to find out what was really happening to immigrant families ripped apart at our border. I saw right away: It wasn’t a unification center—it was a prison. https://t.co/aAP8eTmN8eI agree with @JulianCastro: We shouldn\\'t criminalize families trying to build a better future. We need comprehensive immigration reform that\\'s in line with our values and creates a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, including our DREAMers. https://t.co/KWzLmVnEBFQueens: I hope you make your voices heard today and vote for @CabanForQueens if you haven’t already! Polls are open until 9:00 PM ET. https://t.co/RecNhXVzZRI stand with the hundreds of @Wayfair employees who are planning to stage a walkout at their Boston headquarters tomorrow. The safety and well-being of immigrant children is always worth fighting for. https://t.co/L3hqbazX4lAmazon has too much power. Under my plan to #BreakUpBigTech, entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against tech giants. https://t.co/EdsvdA48tEMy #UltraMillionaireTax is a two-cent tax on the 75,000 biggest fortunes in the country. We’d use it to pay for #UniversalChildCare, student loan debt relief, free public college, and a lot more. Here’s how it works. https://t.co/mtPIBSNdN6The Trump administration’s treatment of the people of Puerto Rico continues to be a complete failure. Our government needs to follow through and provide the aid that is rightfully owed to the island immediately. \\nhttps://t.co/PEisWubibuIt’s time to make voting easy and convenient, stop racist voter suppression, and secure our elections. I\\'ve got a plan to protect our democracy. https://t.co/aGAAlzqaeSOur democracy is too important for our elections to be under-resourced, undermined, and vulnerable. We need to do everything we can to make sure our elections are convenient, professional, and secure. Read my full plan here: https://t.co/WV0BqmmKjUFinally, we\\'ll provide incentives and resources for states to improve state elections—and where racist or corrupt politicians refuse to follow the law, the federal government will temporarily take over the administration of their federal elections to guarantee the right to vote.Next, we\\'ll establish federal standards to ensure everyone can vote, including mandating automatic and same-day registration, early voting, and vote by mail. No more arbitrary voter purges, registration issues, or gerrymandering. We\\'ll make Election Day a national holiday.I\\'ll start by making sure federal elections get state-of-the-art machines, ballots, and security. We\\'ll replace every voting machine in the country with state-of-the-art equipment and require adoption of a uniform federal ballot. And we\\'ll make sure those systems are secure.We need a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote. But we can also take action now. The federal government has the power to regulate federal elections, secure our democracy, and put a stop to racist voter suppression.Our elections are less secure than your Amazon account. They\\'re under-resourced and undermined by partisan and racist officials who try to stop people from exercising their right to vote. We need to protect our democracy—and I’ve got a plan for that: https://t.co/WV0BqmmKjUWe have a plan for #UniversalChildCare—and a bill to make it happen. I’m glad we’re in this fight together, @Deb4CongressNM! https://t.co/wDR2KSlYvMOur laws should reflect our values. A two-cent tax on the wealthiest 75,000 fortunes will help rebuild the middle class and give every family a shot at the American dream. https://t.co/N0NiyiXJbrDonald Trump’s cruel threats of ICE raids are fear-mongering of the worst kind. In a Warren administration, we’ll protect immigrant families, fix our broken immigration system, and treat immigrant communities with dignity. https://t.co/LdEj4ncRRRPrivate immigration detention centers are exploitation for profit, and I’m glad to see Illinois ban them. My plan to end private prisons would require the rest of the country to do the same. https://t.co/yTdXkYTYyVMy friend and colleague, Senator @JeanneShaheen, is a champion for working families in New Hampshire.

Let’s help her win: https://t.co/ahO5kqV5fCPeople are dying at our border: Moms, babies, families sacrificing everything. We need to fix the Trump administration’s hateful immigration policies that treat immigrants like animals. Immigrant families belong together and deserve to be treated with respect. https://t.co/JB91WWd8cvThe cost of child care held me back until my Aunt Bee stepped in to help take care of Alex and Amelia. Today, it’s holding Amber and her family back. Every family should have access to high-quality, affordable child care. #UniversalChildCare https://t.co/iUiQa1u3zkTogether we can rebuild the middle class and make our economy work for the people—and I’ve got plans to actually make it happen. Will you chip in $3 to help build our grassroots operation across the country? Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win. https://t.co/UoJBy0H8pRThe 8 Mile Wall was built in the 1940s to separate Black families from white families.

It should be safe and easy to vote—that’s why I’m fighting for a constitutional amendment that guarantees the right to vote and to have that vote counted. https://t.co/rJHfXtXKvUI do! My latest plan would ban all private prisons &amp; detention facilities and stop companies from charging incarcerated &amp; detained people for essential services, so we can finally put an end to private profiteering off of cruelty.

Deeply grateful for our conversation this morning at #NALEOMiami! https://t.co/3S5V1VrBUrDeporting hundreds of families—separating more children from their parents in the process—is inhumane. Our immigration policies should reflect America\\'s values, not betray them. My administration will defend and protect immigrants and their families. https://t.co/p8Dc4woi6rWe need to face the systemic problems in our immigration system by providing a pathway to citizenship, protecting our #DREAMERs, and keeping families together. My new plan to shut down private prisons and detention facilities is a step in that direction. #NALEOMiami https://t.co/29WAZt3sCaIt\\'s not enough to say that we don\\'t want conflict—we must make one less likely. Congress must make clear that war with Iran is not authorized. We should work with our allies to deescalate tensions and create space for diplomacy. We can\\'t afford another forever war.When it comes to the future of our country, it’s not a question of more government or less government. It’s about who government works for.\\n\\nIn a Warren administration, our government will work for the people.In just a few minutes, I’ll be on the stage at #NALEOMiami. I hope you’ll tune in! https://t.co/2PfCTb7gbsWashington hands billions to corporations profiting off of inhumane detention and incarceration policies while ignoring the families that are destroyed. It\\'s corruption, plain and simple. Incarcerating and detaining millions for profit doesn’t keep us safe. We must do better.Finally, I\\'ll hold contractors accountable by expanding oversight, transparency and enforcement. It’s time to shine sunlight on the black box of private services that receive taxpayer dollars.Next, I\\'ll prohibit contractors from charging service fees for essential services, like phone calls, bank transfers, and health care. Companies shouldn’t be able to treat incarcerated individuals as captive profit centers.First, I\\'ll end all contracts between the Bureau of Prisons, ICE, and the U.S. Marshals Service and private detention providers. There should be no place in America for profiting off of putting more people behind bars or in detention.The government has a basic responsibility to keep the people in its care safe—not to use their punishment and detention as an opportunity for profit. As president, I\\'ll ban all private prisons and detention facilities: https://t.co/CUduueEhP5Our criminal and immigration systems are tearing apart communities of color and devastating the poor, including children. Women—especially women of color—are particularly saddled with the financial burden.And the exploitation doesn’t end when people leave these facilities. For-profit supervision companies (which are often run by the same private prison corporations) get rich by charging outrageous fees for monitoring and supervision services like ankle monitors.The companies running prisons and detention centers regularly sacrifice safety to boost their bottom line. Private contractors in both public and private centers regularly cut corners to maximize margins and come up with schemes to make millions off of incarcerated people.The private prison population has grown rapidly since 2000. And with Donald Trump in the White House, private prison companies saw an opportunity to make millions off of his cruel immigration policies. Today, 73% of detained immigrants are held in private detention facilities.Private prison companies have spent millions to turn our criminal and immigration policies into ones that prioritize making them rich instead of keeping us safe—with terrible consequences. Today I’m announcing my plan to end this private profiteering off of cruelty.Donald Trump promised to bring our troops home. Instead he has pulled out of a deal that was working and instigated another unnecessary conflict. There is no justification for further escalating this crisis—we need to step back from the brink of war. https://t.co/roUHtzRlE8Here\\'s my big idea: I want to cancel student loan debt and provide universal free college. And we can pay for it all with my Ultra-Millionaire Tax. https://t.co/yLI7PF4f5bThis is what happens when the president of the United States picks a former big coal lobbyist to lead the @EPA. I’ve got not one but two plans to ensure that, in a Warren administration, we’ll make big, structural changes to protect our environment.\\nhttps://t.co/5oTjMIzD4rWe’re ready to fight this with all we’ve got. https://t.co/6HGdvCdavrThis is more than just a bad ruling—it’s condoning an ugly attack targeted at women with low incomes and women of color. We’ll fight this. https://t.co/ZJsVv6wS1GCA’s Student Borrower Bill of Rights will help thousands of students. I\\'ll keep fighting to go a step further: Making public college free for all and canceling student debt for 95% of Americans who have it.\\nhttps://t.co/2mGlISBQLbI already introduced the most sweeping plan since Watergate to root out corruption. And when it comes to national security, I went even further: A bill that would slam the revolving door between giant contractors and the Pentagon. Read more about it here: https://t.co/YN5itD2xeKDonald Trump named a former top @Raytheon executive to replace a former @Boeing executive at @DeptOfDefense. We need to call this out for what it is: A transition of power at the Pentagon from one huge defense contractor to another. #EndCorruptionNow https://t.co/KjMeAvkHKZ@shannonrwatts @MomsDemand Thanks for fighting the good fight every day, Shannon. Together, we will end the gun violence epidemic in America.Trump provoked this crisis, and his reckless foreign policy by tweet will only worsen it. I\\'ve co-sponsored legislation to prohibit a war with Iran. We need to de-escalate tensions—not let the war hawks in this administration drag us into conflict. #NoWarWithIranThis @UN investigation makes it clear: The Saudi Arabian government deliberately planned to murder @WashingtonPost journalist Jamal Khashoggi. He and his family deserve justice—but Donald Trump has done nothing to hold the Saudis accountable. https://t.co/9RtnQTEV1gI\\'m glad to see the Oklahoma Supreme Court has upheld a petition allowing the people to vote on Medicaid expansion. Health care is a basic human right, and all Okies should be able to access health care.\\nhttps://t.co/eM5nKqLgVgA few months ago I met @Liat_RO, a public school science teacher and activist, at an organizing event in Brooklyn, NY. Liat gave me a great idea: The next Secretary of Education should be a former public school teacher. I agreed—and pledged to make it happen. https://t.co/zngF1bCegcI’m glad to introduce the Refund Equality Act in the Senate. Our bill ensures legally-married, same-sex couples can claim the tax refunds they earned, but were denied before marriage equality was the law of the land. https://t.co/01rgfSiXUQI’ve got a plan:\\n\\n✔ For Universal Child Care\\n✔ To break up Big Tech\\n✔ For student debt cancellation and free public college\\n\\nAnd I’m just getting started! Donate $3 to help me keep the momentum going and meet our FEC fundraising deadline. https://t.co/B2j9vELRkcAmerica needs to face the things we’ve done wrong and take steps towards making it right. My housing plan creates a first-of-its-kind down-payment assistance program to help Black and Brown families living in formerly redlined neighborhoods buy a home. https://t.co/WL9FXFTHLhOn #Juneteenth, I’m thinking about how our country needs big, structural change to confront the oppression that Black Americans still face today. Black lives matter, Black citizens matter, Black families matter. https://t.co/qvTPYUa5VlOur country must confront the impact that generations of slavery and racist policies still have on Black Americans. I support legislation to study and develop plans for reparations. https://t.co/UMZLAdELG9It’s long past time to bring our troops home, and Congress should always have a vigorous and very public debate before sending our troops into harm\\'s way. I support @BLeeForCongress\\'s amendment to repeal the current AUMF and help #EndForeverWar. https://t.co/aA4PgAKYYIRight now, the average cost of child care for one child can take up to 36% of a family’s total income. My plan for #UniversalChildCare would make child care free for millions of families and affordable for everyone. https://t.co/sksRUOTNMZThis is exactly right. Congress should pass new federal laws that protect access to reproductive health care for everyone. https://t.co/XdGVN6X2BeFacebook has too much power and a terrible track record when it comes to protecting our private information. We need to hold them accountable—not give them the chance to access even more user data. #BreakUpBigTech https://t.co/eQr06VMMyxWoo-hoo! I’m deeply grateful that you’re part of this fight. One by one, we’re going to return the power to the people and win in 2020. #NVertheless https://t.co/8ygUrDYsPkI’m proud to endorse Tiffany Cabán for Queens DA in New York. @CabanForQueens will fight for working families and work to end mass incarceration. Make sure you get out and vote for Tiffany next Tuesday, June 25th. In the meantime, head to https://t.co/JrGgDWxrHh to volunteer!We need the people making investment decisions to look like the rest of America. That’s why I have a new plan: A Small Business Equity Fund to help close the startup capital gap for entrepreneurs of color. https://t.co/SrmWFK8E35Juneteenth isn’t just about celebrating the end of slavery in Texas. It’s a necessary reminder that 154 years later, Black Americans still feel the harsh reality that the fight for racial equality in our country is far from over. I’m in that fight all the way.Donald Trump’s treatment of those seeking a better life in our country is inhumane. Make no mistake: In a Warren administration, we will defend and protect immigrants and their families. https://t.co/jYYp0Vh18g#UniversalChildCare is personal for me. I struggled to find care for my babies—until my Aunt Bee stepped in. Not everyone is lucky enough to have an Aunt Bee, and this plan is for them. Try my calculator to see how much you\\'d save under my plan. https://t.co/urL0bLuxrgI’ve got a plan—and now a bill—for #UniversalChildCare. Today, Rep. @Deb4CongressNM and I introduced a new proposal that would make high-quality, affordable child care a reality for every family in America. https://t.co/pKLLr2rYCBAt @UniteThePoor’s #PPCMoralCongress yesterday, I talked with @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo about how @TeamWarren is building a grassroots operation across the country. I’ve been to 20 states and Puerto Rico—and we’re just getting started! https://t.co/ykUuRa8ddeI’m fighting for @CDCgov funding to study gun violence alongside @BradyBuzz and @AMarch4OurLives. #WeNeedToKnow how to end the gun violence epidemic in our country once and for all. https://t.co/vAjsdGKaXYIf you’re getting crushed by student loan debt, there’s a good chance our new bill will help. Use my calculator to see how much of your debt would get canceled under the Warren-Clyburn proposal: https://t.co/5ii8O6kr2U #CancelMyDebtMy new plan with Rep. James Clyburn:\\n\\n✅ Cancels student loan debt for more than 95% of people who carry it\\n✅\\xa0Wipes out *all* debt for more than 75% of people who carry it \\n\\nIt’s the big, structural change that our economy and our students need.\\nhttps://t.co/y1oDmrMY97Part of confronting America’s racial wealth gap is acknowledging the role that our federal government played in keeping Black and Brown Americans from home ownership. That’s why my plan for fair housing provides assistance for families living in formerly redlined areas. https://t.co/OvpP6mGRC1Health care is a basic human right, but right now our health care is under attack. The rules are written in favor of Big Pharma and health insurance executives—while rural communities get kicked to the curb. Time for #MedicareForAll. https://t.co/cMTK967Z7FI hope Iran chooses a different path. But let\\'s be clear: Trump provoked this crisis. He has no strategy to contain it, he\\'s burned through our friends and allies, and now he\\'s doubling down on military force. We can\\'t afford another forever war. https://t.co/KxEcvtEQSnI don’t spend time at fancy fundraisers. Instead, I spend my time meeting voters and thanking grassroots donors who chip in what they can. Donate $3 to my campaign, and you might just get a call from me to thank you! https://t.co/qvWn3CqUnTIt was never about a cake—it’s about making sure no one has a license to discriminate against LGBTQ+ Americans. The lower court needs to make the right decision, and until then, we’ll keep fighting for equal rights. \\nhttps://t.co/c2FAngNsUrDeeply saddened by the loss of my friend Frank LaMere. Frank was a longtime @DNC member and @WinnebagoTribe activist, and I’m going to miss him. https://t.co/4R7v24PJ72We’re in the fight for racial and economic justice. Thank you @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo for a powerful conversation at the #PPCMoralCongress! https://t.co/4ynfivWWw0I agree with @IAmJohnOliver: No president is above the law. Congress should do its job and begin impeachment proceedings. https://t.co/1bj6v4OLZyAt the #BlackPresidentialForum this weekend, we talked about how discrimination was actively fostered by the U.S. government—and how I have multiple plans to close the racial wealth gap. \\nhttps://t.co/OdkBfiaSFOI’m still heartsick for the lives we lost that day. In a Warren administration, we will use the Justice Department to end the rise of white supremacy. https://t.co/GwthGgsinZIt’s an honor to fight for economic justice alongside @RevDrBarber and Rev. @LizTheo! Looking forward to the @UniteThePoor’s #PPCMoralCongress today and discussing how we can overcome systemic racism and inequality. Tune in at 4:00 PM ET to watch: https://t.co/oHCLzWMtUQWe can end the student loan debt crisis that’s crushing millions of Americans—and we can make universal free college a reality. Will you become a citizen co-sponsor of Rep. James Clyburn’s and my bill to solve the student loan debt crisis? #CancelMyDebt https://t.co/HkZUBDDgDRWe can’t build a future by crushing the dreams and hopes of our young people. That\\'s why Rep. James Clyburn and I introduced a bill to cancel up to $50,000 of your student loan debt, so that you can achieve your goals and dreams. #CancelMyDebt https://t.co/pY0ociqDq8For far too long the American Dream has been out of reach for Black business owners. I\\'ve got a plan to fix that, starting with a $7 billion dollar fund to help them start and grow their own small businesses. #BlackPresidentialForum https://t.co/eA2d8UzhCvI hope you’ll read this powerful story from my friend, @AdyBarkan. We need #MedicareForAll—and you bet I’m fighting for it all the way. \\nhttps://t.co/HDp6AkMxR8I knew my father always had my back. He wanted to make sure I could chase after my dreams. Here’s why I wouldn’t be here today if my daddy hadn’t pushed open a door so I could have a fighting chance. https://t.co/nCNpg2j1inHappy Father’s Day to all the dads who are fighting for their children’s futures—and who set the example every day of what it means to care for the people you love. My daddy was a cool guy. He taught me to dream big and fight hard, and I wish I could call him today. https://t.co/o0PYOixqVRDana Martin. Ashanti Carmon. Claire Legato. Muhlaysia Booker. Paris Cameron. Michelle “Tamika” Washington. Chynal Lindsey. Jazzaline Ware. Chanel Scurlock. And now Zoe Spears. The murder of Black trans women is a crisis. We’ll fight this, and we will continue to say their names. https://t.co/k2f6iL123OToday seven years ago, President @BarackObama implemented #DACA to give a generation of immigrants a chance to build a future in the country they call home. I will #DefendDACA and keep standing up to Donald Trump’s cruel attacks on immigrant communities.My new plan will create jobs, spur economic growth, and move us closer to an America where everyone has a fair shot to succeed. https://t.co/A7eIxEFVZuIt should be quick and easy to join a union. Let’s keep up this fight so casino workers in Nevada and across the country have the right to unionize and collectively bargain. #FightFor15 https://t.co/3Vyp42FgiJWe need to do better by America’s workers—and that means economic justice. I’m in the #FightFor15 because we need to make living wages a reality. https://t.co/ek3o443eSGMy friend @JasonKander is a powerful advocate for our veterans and breaking down the stigma around PTSD. Thank you for your bravery, Jason. https://t.co/1bkKjwDXVSEvery American should have a fair shot at starting a small business—but today, the playing field is tilted against Black and Brown entrepreneurs. My new plan would put an end to that. https://t.co/Vf9uKu12YgMy first Democratic presidential primary debate is on Wednesday, June 26 on @NBCNews—and I can’t wait to discuss my plans for big, structural change. Will you chip in $3 now to keep up the momentum before June 26? https://t.co/s9Q1XA4blFJared Kushner is a walking conflict of interest. After he failed to fully divest from his family’s real estate empire, Freddie Mac is now guaranteeing Kushner Cos. an $800 million loan. We need answers on whether his company got special treatment.\\nhttps://t.co/5U9h4RUs8tLet’s fight hard and #FlipVABlue, together! https://t.co/eGXLxwq6vEIf you have good ideas and work hard, you should be able to build a small business and make a living. Black and Brown entrepreneurs are held back by a start-up capital gap that makes it harder to start and grow their business. I\\'ve got a plan to fix that. https://t.co/e4Z9ZJzEAgI’d love to grab a drink and chat with you. Donate here to be automatically entered—and I hope I’ll see you soon! https://t.co/6BJhzS7BJy https://t.co/Z1inhaj01eI’m looking forward to the first debate of the Democratic presidential primary on Wednesday, June 26 on @NBCNews and having an opportunity to discuss my plans for big, structural change in this country. Let’s dream big, fight hard, and win!'"
